The length and position of the alternating 'ABA' pattern\n2. The distribution of 'B's throughout the sequence\n3. The length of 'A' clusters at the beginning and middle of the sequence\n\nBy exploring these subtle variations, we hope to either find an even better solution or confirm that we've found the optimal configuration. Given that we've already found two good solutions, we're in an excellent position to refine our results further."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nAAABBABABABAAABABBBA: 7.383\nAAABBBABABAAAABABBBA: 1.863\nAAABBABABABABABABBBA: 11.890\nAAABBBABABBAAABABBBA: 8.698\nAAABBBBABABABABABBBA: 11.932\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
