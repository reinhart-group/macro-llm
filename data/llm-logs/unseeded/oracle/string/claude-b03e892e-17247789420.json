Trying different ending patterns.\n\nThe goal is to fine-tune the arrangement to get closer to the target distance of less than 1.34. We're making small, strategic changes to our best-performing sequence to see if we can push the distance lower, while also introducing some variations to avoid getting stuck in a local minimum. We're particularly interested in seeing if subtle changes in the distribution of 'A's and 'B's in the latter part of the sequence can make a significant difference in the distance."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nAAAABBBABAABAAABBABA: 3.276\nAAAABBBBBAABAAABBAAB: 3.433\nAAAABBBABABBAAABBABA: 6.929\nAAAABBBBBAABAAABBAAA: 4.828\nAAAABBBABABBAAAABABA: 7.795\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions. Please propose five new 20-character sequences (12 'A', 8 'B') that build upon the insights from these results to yield distances closer to the target. Remember to: 1. Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
