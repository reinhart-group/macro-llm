The middle section 'ABBAAAABB' or similar patterns have appeared in many good solutions, so we're keeping this general structure in most proposals.\nd. We're avoiding patterns that performed poorly in this and previous iterations, such as having too many 'A's at the start or 'BAABA' at the end.\ne. We're balancing exploitation of patterns from previously successful sequences with exploration of slight variations to try to find better solutions.\nf. Given that this batch didn't produce any good solutions, we're also drawing inspiration from successful patterns in earlier iterations to potentially break out of a local minimum."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nAAABBBBBAAAABBABBBAB: 1.895\nAAABBBBBAAAABBABBAAB: 0.837\nAAABBBBBAAAABAABBAAB: 1.456\nAAABBBBBAAAABAABBAAA: 5.908\nAAABBBBBAAAABAABBABA: 1.881\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.

Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
