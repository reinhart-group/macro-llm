The middle section (AAAABBB) appears to be significant, but we're exploring slight variations in proposals 4 and 5 to ensure we're not missing potential improvements.\nd. We're focusing on exploiting the best-performing sequences by making small variations, particularly in the last few positions where changes might have the most impact. We're also exploring one sequence with a slightly different ending to ensure we're not overlooking potential improvements in that area."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nAAABBBABAAAAAABBABAA: 1.673\nAAABBBABAAAAABBABBAA: 0.498\nAAABBBAAAAAAABBBABAA: 4.337\nAAABBBABAAAAAABBBBBA: 0.867\nAAABBBABAAAAABABABBA: 0.386\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.

Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
