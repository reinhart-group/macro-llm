We're also exploring slight variations in the distribution of 'A's and 'B's throughout the sequence, especially in the first half and end parts.\n\nAll of these sequences are new and haven't been proposed in previous batches, maintaining a balance between exploitation of promising patterns and exploration of new possibilities.\n\nWe're still aiming to break the 1.34 threshold, so these fine-tuned adjustments are focused on exploring the nearby solution space of our best performers. The changes are subtle, as we seem to be close to an optimal solution, and small tweaks might make the crucial difference in reaching our target. We're particularly focusing on adjusting the balance of 'A's and 'B's in the first half of the sequence and the pattern at the end, as these seem to be key areas for potential improvement."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nABAAABBBAAAAAABABABA: 4.474\nABAAABBBAAAAABABABAB: 3.289\nABAAABBBAAAAABABBBAB: 3.901\nABAABBBAAAAAABABABBA: 2.258\nABAAABBBAAAAAABBBABB: 3.333\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
