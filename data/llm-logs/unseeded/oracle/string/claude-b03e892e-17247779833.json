Experimenting with the distribution of 'B's in the latter part of the sequence\n4. Testing slight variations in the start of the sequence\n\nAs we're very close to the target, these proposals aim to make subtle adjustments that might provide the final push we need. We're balancing exploitation of our best-performing pattern with careful exploration of slightly different arrangements to avoid getting stuck in a local minimum and hopefully break through the 1.34 threshold."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nABABABABABAAAABBBBAA: 13.498\nABABABABAAAAABBBBAAA: 1.299\nBABABABABAAAAAABBBBA: 9.007\nABABABABAAAAAABBABBA: 3.797\nAABABABABAAAAAABBBBA: 1.943\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.

Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
