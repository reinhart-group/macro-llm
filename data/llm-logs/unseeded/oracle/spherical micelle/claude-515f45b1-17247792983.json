We're focusing heavily on sequences very similar to our top performer, with subtle adjustments to potentially optimize further. \n\nThe emphasis is on:\n1. Maintaining the long streak of 'A' characters at the start (10-11 'A's).\n2. Keeping the \"ABBABBB\" or similar pattern at the end.\n3. Exploring different arrangements of 'B' characters in the middle section.\n\nWe're making very fine adjustments at this stage, as we're already performing exceptionally well with a distance of 0.207. The goal is to see if we can improve upon this impressive result while maintaining the key features that have led to our success. These minor tweaks allow us to thoroughly explore the nearby solution space of our best-performing sequence."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nAAAAAAAAAABABABBABBB: 1.517\nAAAAAAAAAABAAABBBABB: 0.289\nAAAAAAAAABAAABBABBBB: 0.710\nAAAAAAAAAABBAABBABBB: 2.034\nAAAAAAAAAABAAAABABBB: 0.413\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions. Please propose five new 20-character sequences (12 'A', 8 'B') that build upon the insights from these results to yield distances closer to the target. Remember to: 1. Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
