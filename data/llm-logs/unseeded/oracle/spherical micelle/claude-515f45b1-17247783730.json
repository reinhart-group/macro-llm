It's a more exploratory option to prevent getting stuck in local minima.\n\nThese proposals maintain the required 12 'A' and 8 'B' characters while exploring significantly different patterns from our previous attempts. Given the unexpected poor performance of our last batch, we're taking a more exploratory approach to cover a wider range of possible solutions.\n\nWe're testing various grouping strategies and distributions of 'A's and 'B's, including:\n- Starting with 'B's\n- Having longer stretches of consecutive 'A's\n- Incorporating 'BABBB' or 'ABABB' patterns\n- Balancing the distribution of 'B's throughout the sequence\n\nBy exploring these new patterns, we hope to gain fresh insights that can guide our future proposals towards the target of less than 1.34. This approach balances the need for exploration with the constraints of our optimization task, and aims to discover new promising regions in the solution space."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nBABBAAAAAAABAAAABABB: 4.834\nBABAAAAAAAABAABABABB: 5.932\nAAAAAABABBBAAAAABABB: 2.865\nBABAAAABABBAAAABABBA: 9.900\nBAABAAAAAAABAAAABABB: 5.611\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions. Please propose five new 20-character sequences (12 'A', 8 'B') that build upon the insights from these results to yield distances closer to the target. Remember to: 1. Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
