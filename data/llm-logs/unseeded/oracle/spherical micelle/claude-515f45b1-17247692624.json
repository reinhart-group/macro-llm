The fifth proposal explores a slightly different pattern while maintaining the general structure that has proven successful.\n\nBy balancing exploitation of our best results with some continued exploration, we aim to potentially find even better solutions or confirm the optimality of our current best sequence (0.251). Given how close we are to an optimal solution, these small adjustments could be crucial in potentially finding an even better sequence."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nAAAAAAAAABABAAABBBBA: 1.622\nAAAAAAAAAABAABABABBA: 1.787\nAAAAAAAAAABBAAABABBB: 1.429\nAAAAAAAAABAAABABABBB: 0.596\nAAAAABAAAABAAABABBBB: 2.137\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions. Please propose five new 20-character sequences (12 'A', 8 'B') that build upon the insights from these results to yield distances closer to the target. Remember to: 1. Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
