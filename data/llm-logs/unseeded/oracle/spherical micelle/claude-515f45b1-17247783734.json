As we've been unable to break below the 4.0 barrier with our recent attempts, we're now introducing more substantial variations to explore different areas of the solution space.\n\nWe're still maintaining some elements that have shown promise (like starting with multiple 'A's in some sequences), but we're also trying completely new patterns and distributions of 'A's and 'B's.\n\nThe strategy at this stage is to increase our exploration efforts significantly. We're making bolder changes to try to break out of what might be a local minimum. These more diverse sequences might help us discover new promising areas in the solution space that we haven't explored yet.\n\nRemember, we're in the later stages of our optimization process, but as we haven't reached our target, we need to balance our previous learnings with new, more exploratory approaches."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nAAAAABBBBBAAAAAABBAB: 5.249\nAAAAAABBBBBAAAAABBAB: 2.988\nBBBBBAAAAAABBBBAAAAA: 7.024\nAAABBBAAABBBAAABBBAA: 8.418\nAABBAABBAABBAABBAABB: 12.426\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
