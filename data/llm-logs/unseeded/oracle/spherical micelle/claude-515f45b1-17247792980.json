I'm testing if this redistribution of 'A's still produces a good result.\n\nThese sequences maintain the required 12 'A' and 8 'B' characters while focusing on variations of our best-performing sequence. The strategy here is to exploit the successful solution while also exploring very close variations to see if we can find multiple good solutions or potentially an even better one.\n\nI'm particularly focusing on:\n1. Fine-tuning the length of the initial 'A' sequence (8-10 'A's)\n2. Subtle adjustments to the pattern of alternating 'A's and 'B's in the latter half of the sequence\n3. Minor changes to the last few characters\n\nBy making these targeted changes, we aim to explore the immediate neighborhood of our successful solution while still maintaining some level of exploration. This approach might help us identify multiple good solutions or potentially find an even better one."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nAAAAAAAAAABAABABABAB: 0.924\nAAAAAAAAABAAABABABBA: 1.128\nAAAAAAAAABAAABABBABA: 1.345\nAAAAAAAABAAAABABABAB: 2.487\nAABAAAAAAABAABABABAB: 4.339\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
