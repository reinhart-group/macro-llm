The variations include:\n\n1. Keeping the 'BBB' cluster that appeared in our best performers.\n2. Exploring different alternating patterns of 'A's and 'B's following the 'BBB' cluster.\n3. Slightly adjusting the position of the 'BBB' cluster.\n4. Testing different ending patterns.\n\nThese proposals aim to identify if there's a specific arrangement of these final characters that can further optimize the distance metric while maintaining the overall successful structure we've discovered in previous iterations."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nAAAAAAAAAAABBBABBAAB: 1.413\nAAAAAAAAAAABBBAABABB: 0.954\nAAAAAAAAAAAABBBAABAB: 1.197\nAAAAAAAAAAABBBABABAB: 1.102\nAAAAAAAAAABBBAABBABA: 3.642\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.

Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
