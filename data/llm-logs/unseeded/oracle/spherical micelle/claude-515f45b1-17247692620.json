AAAAAAAABAAABBBABAAA\nRationale: This sequence is similar to the best performer but introduces a 'BA' pattern near the end. I'm testing if this slight modification to the end of the sequence improves the distance.\n\n5. AAAAAAABABAABBBAAAAA\nRationale: This sequence reverts to seven initial 'A's but maintains the 'BBB' pattern from the best performer. I'm exploring if this combination of elements from successful sequences yields an even better result.\n\nThese sequences maintain the required 12 'A' and 8 'B' characters while focusing on variations of the best-performing sequence. I'm balancing exploitation of the promising solution with exploration of nearby variations. None of these sequences duplicate previously evaluated ones.\n\nGiven that we're very close to the target of 1.34, I'm making subtle changes to the best-performing sequence while still exploring some variations. I'm particularly focusing on:\n\n1. The number of consecutive 'A's at the start (7 or 8)\n2. The arrangement of 'B's in the middle (particularly the 'BBB' pattern)\n3. The pattern at the end of the sequence (AAAAA vs ABAAA vs AAAAB)\n\nThese factors seem to be critical in determining the distance. As we're in the final iterations of this process, I'm making fine-tuned adjustments, hoping to find the optimal combination that will bring us below the 1.34 threshold. If we don't achieve the target with this batch, we might need to consider more significant changes in the next iteration to explore new areas of the solution space."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nAAAAAAAABAAABBAABAAA: 1.805\nAAAAAAAABAAABBAAAAAB: 1.990\nAAAAAAAABAAABBBABAAA: 1.516\nAAAAAABBABBABABAAAAA: 3.139\nAAAAAAAAAAAABBAABAAA: 3.191\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
