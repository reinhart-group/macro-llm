This tests whether ending with 'AA' instead of 'AB' can yield an even lower distance.\n\n3. We've removed one 'A' from the beginning of our best performer and added it to the end. This explores whether changing the distribution of 'A's while maintaining the overall pattern can improve the result.\n\n4. Similar to our best performer, but we've changed the ending to 'BBA'. This tests whether grouping two 'B's at the end can yield better results.\n\n5. We've added one more 'A' at the beginning compared to our best performer. This tests whether eight consecutive 'A's at the start can further reduce the distance while maintaining the successful ending pattern.\n\nThese proposals continue to exploit the successful pattern we've discovered (starting with multiple 'A's, followed by alternating 'A's and 'B's, and ending with a specific pattern) while still exploring different arrangements. We're focusing on small variations of our best-performing sequences, hoping to find an even better solution than 0.939.\n\nWe're particularly focusing on fine-tuning the number of initial 'A's and the arrangement of 'A's and 'B's in the latter part of the sequence, as these seem to be critical factors in determining the distance.\n\nOur goal is to see if we can improve upon our already successful results while also exploring nearby sequences to ensure we haven't missed an even better solution. This approach balances exploitation of our known good solutions with continued exploration of the solution space."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nAAAAAAAABABABABABBAA: 2.326\nAAAAAAAABABABABABBBA: 2.107\nAAAAAAAABABABABAAABA: 3.572\nAAAAABAABABABABABBAB: 2.470\nAAAAAAAABAAABABABBAA: 1.681\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
