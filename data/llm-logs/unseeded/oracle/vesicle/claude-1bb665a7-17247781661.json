Exploration vs. exploitation: We'll continue to exploit the successful patterns we've identified while introducing subtle variations to explore nearby solutions.\n\nSequence 1 is a slight variation of our best performer, moving the last 'A' to the end.\nSequence 2 keeps the successful first half but explores a new pattern in the second half with more alternating A's and B's.\nSequence 3 slightly modifies the start to \"BAAB\" instead of \"BAAA\" while keeping the rest of the sequence similar to our best performer.\nSequence 4 maintains the successful first half but adjusts the latter half to explore a different B distribution.\nSequence 5 introduces a slight variation in the middle section, changing \"BAABB\" to \"BAABA\", while keeping the start and end similar to our best performer.\n\nThese sequences aim to further refine our understanding of what makes a good solution while still exploring new possibilities. We're focusing on exploiting known good patterns, particularly the \"BAAABAABBAA\" start, while still maintaining some level of exploration in the latter half of the sequences to potentially find even better solutions. The goal is to see if we can improve upon our best result or find other similarly good solutions by making subtle changes to the successful pattern."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nBAAABAABBAAABABABBAB: 5.272\nBAAABAABBAABBABAABAA: 4.150\nBAAABAABBAAABABBABAA: 1.457\nBAAABAABAABABABABBAA: 4.442\nBAAABABBBAAABABABBAA: 2.485\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
