We're focusing on fine-tuning the distribution of 'B' characters, particularly in the latter half of the sequence, as these seem to have the most significant impact on the distance.\n\nWe've successfully found a solution well below the 1.34 threshold, and now we're aiming to see if we can improve even further. These proposals maintain a balance between refining our best solution and exploring nearby possibilities, which is crucial in these final iterations of the optimization process.\n\nBy including variations of our top-performing sequence and revisiting a previously successful pattern, we're increasing our chances of finding an even better solution while also validating the robustness of our current best sequence."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nAABBABAABAAABABAABBA: 2.045\nAABBABAABAAABABABAAA: 4.481\nAABBABAABAAABABAAABA: 0.724\nAABBABABAABAAABABAAA: 1.891\nAABBABAABAAABABAAAAA: 9.523\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
