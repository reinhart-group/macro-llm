AABABBABAABABABAABAA:\nRationale: This sequence keeps the successful start of our best sequence but introduces more alternation between 'A's and 'B's in the latter half.\n\nThese proposals aim to exploit the highly successful pattern we've discovered in our best-performing sequence (\"AABABBABAABABAAABB\"), while making small adjustments to explore the nearby solution space. We're focusing on fine-tuning the distribution of 'A's and 'B's, particularly at the beginning and end of the sequence, as this seems to be critical for achieving lower distances.\n\nOur strategy at this stage is to make targeted adjustments to the best-performing sequence, hoping to find the optimal arrangement that might bring us below the 1.34 threshold for a good solution. We're still maintaining some level of exploration by testing variations in the placement of 'A's and 'B's, especially at the beginning and end of the sequence.\n\nAs we're very close to our target, we're putting more emphasis on exploitation of the successful pattern, but still maintaining a degree of exploration in case there's a nearby arrangement that could provide the final improvement we need. We'll continue to refine our approach based on the results we observe from these proposals."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nAABABBABAABABAAABABA: 10.958\nAABABBABAABABAAABBBA: 6.671\nAAABABBABAABABAAABBA: 3.745\nAABABABBABAABABAABBA: 9.598\nAABABBABAABABABAABAA: 7.473\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
