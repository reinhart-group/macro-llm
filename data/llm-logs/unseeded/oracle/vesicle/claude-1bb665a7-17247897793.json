We're testing if this change in the early pattern can yield an even better result.\n\nThese proposals primarily focus on exploiting the successful pattern we've discovered with AABABAAABAAABBBABABA. We're making subtle changes to this sequence to see if we can further optimize the result. \n\nKey elements we're focusing on:\n- The \"AABABAAA\" start, which has been consistent in our best performers\n- The cluster of three 'B's in the latter half of the sequence\n- The overall distribution of 'A's and 'B's, especially in the ending\n\nWhile we're mainly exploiting our best result, we're still maintaining some level of exploration (especially in proposal 5) to ensure we don't miss any potential better solutions in the nearby solution space.\n\nOur main goal now is to see if we can find an even better solution than 0.485, while also confirming the consistency of our best result so far. We're getting very close to the optimal solution, so these fine-tuned adjustments might make the crucial difference."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nAABABAAABAAABBBABAAB: 2.014\nAABABAAABAAABBABBABA: 1.180\nAABABABAABAAABBBABAA: 2.009\nAABABAAAAAAABBBABABA: 8.874\nAABBBAAABAAABBBABABA: 2.505\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
