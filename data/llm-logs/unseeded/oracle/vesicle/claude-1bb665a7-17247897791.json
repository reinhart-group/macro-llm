This sequence introduces a slight variation in the beginning, moving one 'B' earlier, while maintaining the successful \"BBB\" pattern later. This explores whether a different distribution of 'B's in the first half can yield better results.\n\nThese proposals aim to:\n- Reaffirm our best-known solutions (sequences 1 and 2)\n- Explore minor variations of these successful patterns (sequences 3, 4, and 5)\n- Focus on the \"AABAB\" start that has consistently performed well\n- Maintain the \"BBB\" or \"BBBB\" pattern in the second half\n- Test slight variations in the distribution of 'A's and 'B's, particularly in the first half and at the very end of the sequence\n\nThis approach balances exploitation of our best-known solutions with careful exploration of nearby patterns. We're aiming to find sequences that can consistently achieve distances below 1.34 by making small, strategic changes to our most successful sequences so far, while also testing a slightly more divergent pattern in sequence 5."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nAABABAAABAAABBBBABBA: 0.813\nAABABABAABAAABBBABBA: 2.641\nAABABAAABAABBBBABABA: 6.297\nAAAABAAABAAABBBABBBA: 7.655\nAABABAAABAAABBBAAABA: 0.854\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.

Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
