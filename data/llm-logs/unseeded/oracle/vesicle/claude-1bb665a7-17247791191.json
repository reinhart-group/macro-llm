We're maintaining the overall balance of 12 A's and 8 B's, and continuing to focus on the alternating pattern of A's and B's that has shown to be crucial for good performance.\n\nThe goal remains to find more solutions below the 1.34 threshold or potentially even improve upon our excellent 0.265 solution. By making subtle changes to this very successful pattern, we hope to either find even better solutions or confirm the robustness of our current best sequence. We're also exploring whether small changes in different parts of the sequence (beginning, middle, end) have different impacts on the performance."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nABAABAABAAAABABABAAA: 2.104\nABAABAAABAAABABABBAA: 1.264\nBBAABAAABAAABABABAAA: 4.098\nABAABAAAAAAABABABAAA: 7.636\nABAABAAABAABBABABABA: 10.788\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions. Please propose five new 20-character sequences (12 'A', 8 'B') that build upon the insights from these results to yield distances closer to the target. Remember to: 1. Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
