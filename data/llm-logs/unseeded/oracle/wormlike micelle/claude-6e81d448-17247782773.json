We're testing if this new ending can improve the result.\n\nThese proposals are focused on exploiting the patterns that have given us our best results so far (1.296 and 1.620). We're making small, strategic changes to these successful sequences to see if we can reduce the distance below the 1.34 threshold.\n\nWe're avoiding patterns that led to higher distances (above 2.5) from the last batch. Our focus is on refining the 'AAAABB(A/B)BB(A/B)AABBB(A/B)B(A/B)(B/A)' pattern, which seems very promising.\n\nAs we're very close to our target (distance < 1.34), we're putting most of our emphasis on exploitation of these promising patterns. However, we've still included some variations (like proposals 3 and 5) to maintain a small degree of exploration. We're paying particular attention to the last few characters of the sequence, as small changes here seem to have a significant impact on the distance."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nAAAABBBABBAAABBBABAA: 2.896\nAAAABBABBBAAABBABBAB: 1.367\nAAAABBBABBAABBBABABA: 5.190\nAAAABAABBBAAABBBAAAA: 6.007\nAAAABBABBAAAABBBBAAB: 2.805\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions. Please propose five new 20-character sequences (12 'A', 8 'B') that build upon the insights from these results to yield distances closer to the target. Remember to: 1. Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
