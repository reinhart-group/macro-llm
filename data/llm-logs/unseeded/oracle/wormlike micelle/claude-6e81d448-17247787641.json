We're exploring if this combination can yield better results, given that both parent sequences performed well.\n\n5. This sequence keeps the successful start of 'AAAABABB' but introduces a different middle section 'AABBAABB' followed by 'ABAB' at the end. We're testing if this new arrangement, which includes more 'BB' pairs, can improve the distance.\n\nThese proposals continue to exploit the patterns of our best-performing sequences while making small adjustments to explore nearby solution spaces. We're focusing on very minor variations, particularly in the last few characters of the sequence, as we're now very close to our target threshold.\n\nWe're maintaining the required 12 'A' and 8 'B' characters in all sequences and avoiding any previously evaluated sequences. The goal is to make subtle refinements to the arrangement, especially in the second half of the sequence, to try to get below the 1.34 threshold.\n\nGiven that we're in the final stages of our optimization process and very close to our target, these proposals aim to make extremely small, refined changes to our best-performing sequences. We're exploring slight variations in the positioning of 'A's and 'B's, especially in the last 3-4 characters, which seem to have a crucial impact on the distance metric at this stage of optimization."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nAAAABABBAABAAABBABAA: 4.829\nAAAABABBAABAAABBABBA: 3.034\nAAAABABBAABAAABABBAB: 2.211\nAAAABABBAABAABBBABAA: 3.823\nAAAABABBAAABAABBABAB: 1.742\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
