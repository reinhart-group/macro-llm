We're focusing on minor changes in the arrangement of 'A's and 'B's in the latter half of the sequence, as this seems to be where small adjustments can have a significant impact.\nd. While heavily exploiting our two best-performing patterns, we're still introducing some variations to potentially find an even better solution or confirm that we've found the optimal arrangement.\n\nThese proposals aim to refine our two best-known solutions while still allowing for some exploration of nearby possibilities. As we're in the final stages of our iterations, we're putting more emphasis on exploitation of the best-performing patterns, but still maintaining a small degree of exploration to potentially find an even better solution or confirm that we've found the optimal arrangement."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nAAAABABABBAAABABBBAA: 2.556\nAAAABABABBAAABABBABA: 2.240\nAAAABABABBAAABABBAAB: 1.203\nAAAABABABBAABABABABB: 1.696\nABAABABABBAAABABABAB: 17.866\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
