We're focusing on:\n- Maintaining the 'AAAAABBBAAAB' start that has proven consistently successful\n- Experimenting with different arrangements of 'A's and 'B's in the middle and end portions\n- Exploring the effect of clustering 'A's or 'B's in different positions\n- Trying variations on the number of consecutive 'B's at the end\n\nThis approach balances exploitation of our previous insights with exploration of new patterns. We're aiming to find sequences that can break through our current plateau and perform better than our best of 1.296. By introducing more significant variations while still maintaining some successful elements, we hope to discover new promising areas in the solution space."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nAAAAABBBAAABABABBBAB: 1.524\nAAAAABBBAAABBABABBAB: 1.549\nAAAAABBBAAABABBBAAAB: 0.523\nABAAABBBAAABBABAABBB: 12.575\nAAAAABBBBAABABABBBAB: 1.978\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions. Please propose five new 20-character sequences (12 'A', 8 'B') that build upon the insights from these results to yield distances closer to the target. Remember to: 1. Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
