We're making subtle changes to the arrangement of 'A's and 'B's, particularly focusing on the position of the third 'B' and the size of the middle 'A' group, as these seem to be crucial in determining the distance metric.\n\nWe're trying to balance between exploiting the structure of our best performer so far and introducing small variations that might push us below the 1.34 threshold. The hope is that one of these minor adjustments will provide the small improvement we need to reach our target."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nAABAAABAAAAAAABBAABB: 5.518\nAABBAABABAAAAABBAABB: 6.447\nAABBABAAAAAAABBBAABB: 0.942\nAABAAABAAAAAAABBABBB: 5.799\nAABBAABABAAAAAABAABB: 4.400\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.

Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
