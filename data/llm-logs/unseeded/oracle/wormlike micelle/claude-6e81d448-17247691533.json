By maintaining some similarity to the best performer while also introducing new patterns, we aim to avoid getting stuck in a local minimum while still refining our search in promising areas of the solution space.\n\nWe're particularly focusing on:\n1. The arrangement of 'B's, especially the 'BBB' group that appeared in the best performer.\n2. The distribution of 'A's around these 'B' groups.\n3. The overall balance of 'A's and 'B's throughout the sequence.\n\nRemember, we're looking for subtle changes that might push us below the 1.34 threshold, so we're making careful adjustments to patterns that have worked well in this latest batch."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nAAABAABABBBAAAAABABB: 6.014\nAAABAAABABBAABBAABAB: 6.466\nAABAAABAAABBBBBAABAA: 16.182\nABABAAAABBABBAAABAAB: 19.321\nAAAAAAAABABBBABBBBAA: 8.760\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
