AAAAABBBAAAABABABABB\nRationale: We're exploring a different distribution of 'B's in the latter half while keeping the successful initial pattern.\n\n5. AAAAABBBAAAABAAABBAB\nRationale: We're reintroducing this sequence which performed well in the previous round (0.880) to compare its performance with our new best solution.\n\nChain-of-thought reasoning:\na. The initial pattern of \"AAAAABBB\" continues to be crucial for good performance.\nb. The middle section with four consecutive 'A's appears to be important for good performance.\nc. The distribution of 'B's in the latter half, particularly the \"BABAB\" pattern, seems to be key in achieving low distances.\nd. Small changes in the last few positions can have a significant impact on the distance.\n\nThese proposals aim to exploit our newly found best solution (0.607) while still exploring nearby variations. We're making fine adjustments, particularly to the latter part of the sequences, as this seems to be where the most impactful variations occur. \n\nOur strategy at this point is to thoroughly explore the neighborhood of our best solution, as we're likely very close to the optimal sequence. We're focusing on the \"BABAB\" pattern in the latter half, which seems to be a key factor in the low distance.\n\nWe're also reintroducing a previously successful sequence to ensure we haven't overlooked any potential optimal solutions and to provide a benchmark for our new proposals. This approach balances the need to potentially find an even better solution with the risk of moving away from the good solutions we've already found."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nAAAAABBBAAAABBABABAA: 0.830\nAAAAABBBAAAABBABAABB: 0.278\nAAAAABBBAAAABBABBBAA: 0.713\nAAAAABBBAAAABABABABB: 0.470\nAAAAABBBAAAABAAABAAB: 3.138\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
