While focusing heavily on exploiting the successful patterns, we're still introducing some variations to potentially find an even better solution.\n\nThese proposals aim to further refine the successful patterns we've discovered while still allowing for some exploration of nearby solutions. As we're in the final stages of our iterations, we're putting more emphasis on exploitation of the best-performing patterns, but still maintaining a small degree of exploration to potentially find an even better solution or confirm that we've found the optimal arrangement."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nAAAABABABBAAAABBABBA: 1.326\nAAAABABABBAAAABBBABA: 1.740\nAAAABABABBBAABBABBAB: 3.954\nAAAABABABBAAAAAABABB: 2.237\nAAABBABABBAAAAABBABA: 4.396\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions. Please propose five new 20-character sequences (12 'A', 8 'B') that build upon the insights from these results to yield distances closer to the target. Remember to: 1. Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
