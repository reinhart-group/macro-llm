AAABBBAAAAAABABBABB\nRationale: Similar to the best performer, but moving the group of 3 'B's earlier and adjusting the end.\n\n2. AAAAABBBAAAAAABBABB\nRationale: Starting with a longer string of 'A's, followed by a group of 'B's, then another long string of 'A's.\n\n3. AAABBBAAAAABABBAABB\nRationale: Keeping the early 'AAA' and 'BBB' groups from the best performer, but rearranging the latter part.\n\n4. AAAAABBBBAAAABAAABB\nRationale: Returning to a pattern similar to our earlier successful sequences, to see if it still performs well.\n\n5. AAABBAAAAABBBABBAAA\nRationale: Exploring a new pattern with alternating pairs of 'AA' and 'BB', and a longer 'BBB' group in the middle.\n\nThese sequences maintain the required 12 'A's and 8 'B's while building upon the insights from our recent results and earlier successful patterns. They all start with multiple 'A's, which has been a common feature in better-performing sequences.\n\nWe're focusing on grouping 'A's and 'B's in various ways, particularly incorporating the insight of having a group of 3 'B's relatively early in the sequence, followed by a longer string of 'A's. At the same time, we're not abandoning earlier successful patterns entirely, as seen in the fourth proposal.\n\nThese proposals aim to balance exploiting what seemed to work in the last batch (groups of 3 'B's, longer strings of 'A's) with exploring new arrangements and revisiting previously successful patterns. We're hoping to further improve our results and get closer to the target of less than 1.34 in the next iteration."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nAABBBBBAAAAAABABBAAB: 4.669\nAABABBBAAAAAABABBAAB: 5.479\nAABABBBAAAAAABBBBAAB: 5.309\nBABABBBAAAAAABBBBAAB: 3.067\nBABABBBABAAAABBBBAAB: 9.255\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
