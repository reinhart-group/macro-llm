It's an attempt to see if we can find another good solution with a slightly different start.\n\nThese proposals primarily exploit the successful 'AAAAABABBAAABABB' pattern at the start and middle of our best solutions while exploring minor variations, particularly in the latter half of the sequence. \n\nWe're making subtle changes to the best-performing sequences, as we've already found excellent solutions. The goal now is to see if we can find an even better solution or identify additional sequences that fall below the 1.34 threshold.\n\nWe're maintaining a balance between exploitation (staying very close to the best performers) and exploration (trying different endings and slight variations in 'A'/'B' distributions) to thoroughly explore the solution space around our successful sequences. This approach allows us to potentially find multiple good solutions while still leaving room for possible improvements.\n\nBy including both our current best and a previous good solution, we're also cross-checking our results to ensure we're not missing any important patterns that might lead to even better solutions."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nAAAAABABBAAABABBABAA: 0.844\nAAAAABABBAAABABBBAAB: 0.547\nAAAABABBAAABABBABABA: 2.494\nAAAAABABBAAAAABBABBA: 0.572\nAABAABABBAAABAABBABB: 9.944\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
