We're exploring if this slight increase in 'B' concentration can yield good results while keeping the general pattern.\n\n3. We're revisiting another previously successful sequence to check its performance against our current best and to provide a point of comparison.\n\n4. This sequence keeps the strong start but introduces more alternation between 'A's and 'B's in the latter half. We're testing if this more evenly distributed pattern can produce good results.\n\n5. Here, we're maintaining the successful start but slightly adjusting the middle section, moving one 'B' earlier in the sequence. This tests whether the exact positioning of 'B's in the middle is crucial.\n\nOur strategy at this point is to:\n- Reaffirm the success of our best-performing sequence\n- Explore minor variations in the latter half of the sequence\n- Maintain the successful \"AAAAABBBA\" start in all cases\n- Test different patterns of 'A' and 'B' distribution in the middle and end sections\n\nWe're making these subtle adjustments to fine-tune our understanding of what makes a sequence successful. By balancing between our known good solutions and slight variations, we aim to either confirm our current best or potentially uncover an even better solution. This approach combines exploitation of our best results with careful exploration of the nearby solution space."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nAAAAABBBAAABABBBAAAB: 0.523\nAAAAABBBAAABABABABAB: 0.922\nAAAAABBBAABABBABAABA: 4.656\nAAAAABBBAAABBBBABAAB: 1.498\nAAAAABBAAAABABBABABA: 2.219\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
