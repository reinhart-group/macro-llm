It seems we didn't find any new good solutions in the last batch, but we can use this information to refine our approach. Let's propose five new sequences based on these insights:\n\nProposed sequences:\n\n1. AAABABABAAABAAABBBAA\n2. AAABABABAAABAAABBABB\n3. AABBABABAAABAAABBBAA\n4. AAABABABAAABAAABABBB\n5. AAABABABABAAABABBABA\n\nReasoning:\n\n1. We're returning to our previous best performing sequence (0.804) as it still remains our best solution. It's important to include this to ensure we don't lose our best result.\n\n2. This sequence is a slight modification of our best sequence, changing the last two characters from 'AA' to 'BB'. We're exploring if this minor change at the end can improve the result while maintaining the successful \"AAABABABAAABAA\" start.\n\n3. We're combining the \"AABBABABA\" start (which has been successful in some iterations) with the ending of our best solution. This helps us explore if we can combine successful elements from different good solutions.\n\n4. Another variation of the best sequence, moving the last 'A' to the third position from the end. This maintains the strong start and explores a slight change in the ending pattern.\n\n5. We're including this sequence which performed well in a previous batch (3.109). Although it wasn't a \"good\" solution, it was one of the better performing sequences outside our top results, and it's worth exploring this area of the solution space further.\n\nThese proposals continue to exploit the success of the \"AAABABA\" and \"AABBABABA\" patterns at the start, which have appeared in our good solutions. We're focusing on making small, strategic changes to different parts of the sequence, particularly the endings, to fine-tune our results.\n\nWe're also introducing some variations (like in sequences 3 and 5) to continue exploring the solution space and avoid getting stuck in a local minimum.
