We're maintaining the general structure of alternating 'A's and 'B's with two 'BB' pairs, which seems to perform well.\n\nWe're focusing on fine-tuning the sequence, particularly at the start and end, as these areas have shown to have a significant impact on the distance in previous iterations. The inclusion of two 'BB' pairs seems to be beneficial, so we're maintaining that in most proposals while varying their positions and the surrounding patterns.\n\nBy proposing these variations, we're balancing between exploiting what we know works well and exploring new possibilities. We're avoiding previously evaluated sequences and trying to make incremental improvements based on our best result so far.\n\nThe goal remains to find the right combination that will push our distance below the 1.34 threshold. We're hoping that these subtle variations on our best-performing sequence, combined with some new structural elements, will lead us closer to that target."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nAAABABABBAAABABABAAA: 4.612\nAABABABBAAABABABABAA: 8.678\nBAABABABBAAABABABAAA: 3.791\nAABABABBAABBABABBAAA: 5.414\nAABABABBAAABABABBBAA: 5.725\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
