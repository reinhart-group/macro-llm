It appears that we didn't find any new good solutions in this iteration. Let's use the insights from our overall progress to propose five new sequences, focusing on our best-performing patterns from previous iterations while also introducing some new variations.\n\nProposed sequences:\n\n1. AAABABABAAABAAABBBBA\n2. AAABABABAAABAAABBAAB\n3. AAABABABAAABAAABABBA\n4. AAABABABAAABAAABBABA\n5. AAABABABAAABAAABBBAA\n\nRationale:\n\n1. This sequence remains our best performer (0.650) from previous iterations. We're including it again to verify its performance and ensure we don't lose track of our best solution.\n\n2. This sequence was another top performer (0.677) from earlier iterations. We're reintroducing it to explore the space around our best solutions.\n\n3. This sequence was also a good performer (0.962) from a previous iteration. We're including it to further explore the solution space around our best performers.\n\n4. This sequence was one of our previous good performers (1.299). We're including it to compare its performance with our best solutions and to ensure we've thoroughly explored this area.\n\n5. This sequence was another good performer (0.804) in a previous iteration. We're reintroducing it to explore the space between our good solutions.\n\nThese proposals aim to exploit the highly successful patterns we've discovered in earlier iterations. We're focusing on sequences that maintain the \"AAABABABAAABAAAB\" prefix, which seems to be crucial for good performance, but vary the ending to probe the solution space around our best solutions.\n\nBy reintroducing our previous best performers, we ensure that we don't lose track of good solutions. This approach balances the need to refine our best solutions with the importance of continuing to explore new possibilities in case there's an even better solution nearby.\n\nAt this stage of the optimization process, it's crucial to revisit our best-performing sequences to confirm their performance and to thoroughly explore the area around them. This strategy helps us gain confidence in our results and ensures we haven't missed any potential improvements.\n\nGiven that we've explored many variations and haven't found better solutions in recent iterations, it's possible that we've already found the optimal or near-optimal solutions. By proposing these sequences again, we can verify their performance and potentially conclude that we've successfully optimized the sequence if no better solutions are found."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nAAABABABAABBAAABBBBA: 6.036\nAAABABABAAAAAAABBAAB: 6.889\nAAABABBBAAABAAABABBA: 2.132\nAAABBBABAAABAAABBABA: 0.715\nAAABABABAAABABABBBBB: 4.888\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
