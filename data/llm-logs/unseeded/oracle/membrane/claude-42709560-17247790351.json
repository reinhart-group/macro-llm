We're focusing heavily on sequences that start with 'AABAA' and end with various arrangements of 'ABB' and 'BBB', as these seem to be key elements of our most successful sequences.\n\nWe're particularly interested in the role of the 'B' distribution in the latter half of the sequence, as small changes in this area seem to significantly impact the results. We're also exploring some variations in the first half of the sequence to ensure we're not overlooking potential improvements in that area.\n\nBy making both minor and more significant changes to our best-performing sequences, we aim to thoroughly explore the nearby solution space while also allowing for the possibility of discovering new, potentially better patterns. Our goal is to find sequences that can improve upon our current best distance of 0.604."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nAABAAABBAAAAABBABBBA: 0.326\nAABAAABBAAAAABBAABAB: 1.093\nAABAAABBAAAABBBAABAB: 0.879\nAABAABABAAAAABBAABBB: 1.328\nAABAAABAAAAAABBABBBB: 7.874\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
