Exploring different distributions of 'B's in the latter half of the sequence\n4. Balancing between grouped 'B's (like 'BBB') and more distributed arrangements\n\nThis approach aims to recalibrate our search towards known good solutions while still exploring new possibilities. By combining elements of our best historical results with new variations, we hope to find sequences that yield distances closer to the target."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nAABAABBAAAAABBBAAABB: 2.351\nAABAAABBAAAAAABBBBAB: 1.885\nAABAAABBAAAAABABAAAB: 1.811\nABBAAABBAAAABBBAABAB: 3.210\nAABAAABBAAABABBABBAB: 3.461\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.

Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
