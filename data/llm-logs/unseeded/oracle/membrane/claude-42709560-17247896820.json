The best performing sequence had 'A's grouped at the beginning and end, with 'B's clustered in the middle.\n\nd.

We've found two good solutions in this batch, with AAABBBABAAABAAAABBBA performing exceptionally well at 0.591. This is a significant improvement over our previous best solutions. Let's use these insights to propose five new sequences.\n\nProposed sequences:\n\n1. AAABBBABAAABAAAABBAB\n2. AAABBBABAAABAAABBABA\n3. AAABBBABAAABAAABBBAA\n4. AAABBABABAAABAAABBBA\n5. AABBBABAAABAAAABBBAA\n\nRationale:\n\n1. This sequence is very similar to our best performer (0.591), with a minor change at the end (swapping the last two characters). We're exploiting the successful pattern while exploring a slight variation.\n\n2. We're maintaining the successful \"AAABBBABAAABA\" start, but altering the arrangement of 'A's and 'B's at the end. This explores whether a different ending can yield even better results.\n\n3. This sequence keeps the successful initial pattern but introduces more 'B's towards the end. We're testing if this change in the 'B' distribution can improve the result while maintaining the successful start.\n\n4. We're using the successful start but introducing a slight change in the middle (changing one 'B' to 'A'). This explores whether a small modification in the middle can yield good results.\n\n5. This sequence shifts the start slightly by removing one 'A' from the beginning, but otherwise maintains a pattern similar to our best solutions. This explores whether the exact position of the initial 'A's is crucial.\n\nThese proposals aim to exploit the patterns of our two good solutions while also exploring nearby variations. We're focusing on maintaining the \"AAABBBA\" start, which appears in both good solutions, while varying the latter part of the sequence.\n\nWe're avoiding sequences that start with more than three 'A's or with 'B', as these have consistently performed poorly in previous batches. We're also avoiding long strings of 'A's in the middle or end of the sequence.\n\nThis approach continues to balance exploitation of promising solutions with exploration of nearby sequence space. By making small, targeted changes to successful sequences, we hope to find more good solutions or potentially even better ones. At the same time, we're including some variations to ensure we're not overlooking potential improvements by focusing too narrowly on one pattern."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nAAABBBABAAABAAABBABA: 0.715\nAAABBBABAAABAAABBBAA: 0.841\nAAABBABABAAABAAABBBA: 2.192\nAABBBABAAABAAAABBBAA: 2.538\nAAABBBABBAABAAAABBBA: 3.123\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
