This sequence introduces a slight variation by moving one 'B' earlier to create a 'BB' pair after the initial \"AAABBA\", while maintaining the overall structure that has performed well.\n\nThese proposals aim to refocus our efforts on the patterns that have previously yielded good results (distances < 1.34). We're returning to sequences similar to our earlier successes while still introducing small variations to explore the nearby solution space.\n\nWe're continuing to focus on the \"AAABBAA\" or \"AAABBAABB\" start patterns that have consistently performed well in earlier iterations. We're also maintaining the insight about the importance of 'A' and 'B' clusters rather than alternating characters.\n\nWe're avoiding starting the sequence with 'B' or having too many consecutive 'A's, as these patterns have consistently led to poor performance.\n\nBy revisiting our most successful patterns with slight modifications, we hope to break out of the recent streak of less optimal results and find new sequences that yield distances below 1.34."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nAAABBABBAAAABAABBABA: 4.667\nAAAABAABAAAAAAAABBAA: 10.098\nAAABBAABBBAAABAABABA: 4.536\nAAABBAABAAAABAABAABA: 4.106\nAAABBABBAAAABBAABABA: 3.155\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions. Please propose five new 20-character sequences (12 'A', 8 'B') that build upon the insights from these results to yield distances closer to the target. Remember to: 1. Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
