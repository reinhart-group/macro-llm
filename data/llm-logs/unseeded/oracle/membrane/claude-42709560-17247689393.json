We're testing if this minor variation at the end might lower the distance even further.\n\nThese sequences maintain the required 12 'A's and 8 'B's while focusing on variations of our most successful pattern so far. We're making smaller, more targeted changes to exploit the promising areas of the solution space, particularly focusing on the 'BBAAB' pattern in the first half and the arrangement of 'B's in the second half.\n\nWe're also still introducing some variations (like in the third and fourth proposals) to avoid getting stuck in a local minimum. As we continue, we'll keep refining our approach based on the results we receive, aiming to find more solutions below the 1.34 threshold and potentially improve upon our best result of 1.006 from this iteration."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nAAABBAABAAABAABABABB: 1.470\nAAABBAABAAABAABABABA: 3.687\nAAABBAABAAABAABAABBA: 3.254\nBAABBAABAAABAABABBBA: 11.598\nAAABBAABAAABAABABBAB: 1.561\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.

Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
