At this stage, we're heavily exploiting our best-known solution with minor variations, as we're very close to our target. However, we're still maintaining some level of exploration (particularly in proposals 4 and 5) to avoid getting stuck in a local minimum.\n\nOur strategy is to fine-tune the best-performing pattern while still allowing for some exploration of nearby solution space. We're hoping that one of these subtle changes might be the key to reaching our target of less than 1.34."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nAAABABABABAAABABBAAB: 3.761\nAAABABABABAAABABBABA: 3.109\nAAABAAABABAAABABBBAA: 4.407\nABABABABABAABABABBAA: 17.936\nABBABABABAAABABABBAA: 8.972\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
