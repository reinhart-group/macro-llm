We're focusing on:\n\n- Maintaining the \"AAABBAA\" start, which has been consistently present in good solutions\n- Keeping the \"AAAABBAA\" or \"AAAABAAB\" middle section, which seems to be important\n- Fine-tuning the endings, particularly exploring variations of 'BAAB', 'BABA', and 'BAAA'\n\nThe strategy maintains a balance between exploiting what works well and exploring new possibilities. We're reintroducing some previously successful sequences that still outperform recent attempts, while also making small, controlled changes to explore the nearby solution space. This approach aims to refine our understanding of what makes a good solution while ensuring we don't overlook previously discovered good performers."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nAAABBAABAAAABAABAAAB: 1.835\nAAABBAABBAAABBAABAAB: 1.918\nAAABBBABAAAABBAABABA: 2.678\nAAABAAABAAAABAABAABA: 7.012\nAAABBAAAAAAABBABABAA: 7.843\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
