At the same time, we're introducing some variations to potentially find even better solutions or additional good solutions that meet the criteria.\n\nThe balance between the initial group of A's, the alternating AB patterns, the position of the three consecutive B's, and the distribution of A's at the end appears to be crucial. We're exploring different arrangements of these elements while keeping close to our successful pattern. We're also paying attention to the start and end of the sequence, as these positions seem to play a vital role in determining the distance."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nAAABABABAAAABBBAABAA: 1.898\nAAABABABABAABBBAAABA: 5.643\nAAABABABAAAABBAAAABA: 1.695\nAAABABABAAABBBAAAABA: 3.350\nAAABABABAAABBBBAAABA: 3.467\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.

Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
