They all maintain the required 12 'A' and 8 'B' characters and avoid duplicating previously evaluated sequences.\n\nThe focus is on making small, strategic changes to the best sequence to see if we can further improve the already good result. We're particularly interested in:\n1. The effect of the final 'B' placement\n2. The impact of concentrating 'B's in different parts of the sequence\n3. The influence of slight rearrangements in the latter half of the sequence\n\nThis approach balances exploitation of our newly discovered good solution with careful exploration of nearby sequence space, aiming to potentially find an even better configuration while ensuring we don't miss any important patterns."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nAABAAABBBAAAAABBAAAA: 6.127\nAABAAABBBAAAAABBAABA: 1.197\nAABAABBBBAAAAABBAAAB: 2.168\nAABAAABBBAAAABBAAAAB: 1.277\nAABAAABBBAAAAABBABAA: 0.543\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
