Subtle changes to the distribution of 'A's and 'B's throughout the sequence.\n\nWe're trying to balance between refining our best-performing patterns and introducing small variations to avoid getting stuck in a local minimum. The goal remains to find the optimal arrangement of 'A's and 'B's that can push our distance below the 1.34 threshold.\n\nGiven that we've been consistently above our target, these proposals aim to make very fine adjustments to our best-performing sequence while still allowing for some exploration. We're hoping that these subtle changes might help us break through to a better solution space."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nAAABABABABABABABBAAB: 6.281\nAABABABAABABABABBABA: 16.411\nAAABABABAABABABBABAB: 5.750\nAAABABABABBABABABBAB: 7.026\nAAABABABAABABABBBBAA: 6.702\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.

Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
