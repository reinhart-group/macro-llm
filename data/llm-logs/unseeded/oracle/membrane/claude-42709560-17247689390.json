While we haven't found any new solutions below the 1.34 threshold, the sequence AABBABABAAABAAABBBBA (2.416) shows some promise. Let's use this insight along with our previous best results to propose five new sequences.\n\nProposed sequences:\n\n1. AABBABABAAABAAABABBB\n2. AABBABABAAABAAABBABB\n3. AABBABABAAABAAABBABA\n4. AABBABABAAABAAABBBAB\n5. AABBABAABAABAABABBBA\n\nRationale:\n\n1. This remains our historically best performing sequence (1.170 from six iterations ago). We're including it again to verify its performance and ensure it remains our best solution.\n\n2. This is our second-best historically performing sequence (1.121 from seven iterations ago). We're re-testing it to compare with our current best and ensure we haven't overlooked the global optimum.\n\n3. This sequence is based on our best historical performer (sequence 1), but with the last two characters swapped. It's an attempt to fine-tune the ending of our best-performing pattern.\n\n4. This sequence is derived from the best performer in the last batch (AABBABABAAABAAABBBBA: 2.416), but with the last two characters swapped. We're exploiting this relatively successful pattern while exploring a minimal variation at the end.\n\n5. This sequence maintains the 'AABB' start that has been common in our better performers, but introduces a new pattern in the middle and end. It's a more exploratory attempt to find a new promising direction, while still maintaining some elements of our successful sequences.\n\nThese proposals aim to balance exploitation of our best-known solutions with exploration of new patterns:\n\n- We're retesting our two historically best sequences to confirm their performance and ensure we're not missing the global optimum.\n- We're focusing on making small, strategic changes to our best-known patterns, particularly at the end of the sequences. This approach allows us to thoroughly explore the neighborhood of our best solutions.\n- We're introducing one more exploratory sequence (5) to ensure we're not overlooking potentially promising new patterns.\n\nBy combining these strategies, we hope to either confirm our current best solutions or discover new, potentially better ones. We're concentrating on fine-tuning our most successful sequences, as we seem to be very close to the optimal solution. At the same time, we're introducing enough variation to ensure we're not stuck in a local optimum.\n\nThe focus on the 'AABB' start and the careful manipulation of the ending sequences reflects our learning from previous iterations, where these elements seemed to play a crucial role in determining the distance metric."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nAABBABABAAABAAABBBAB: 1.136\nAABBABAABAABAABABBBA: 9.484\nAABBBBABAAABAAABABBA: 2.823\nAABBABABAAABAAABBBBB: 1.873\nABBBABABAAABAAABBABB: 8.607\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
