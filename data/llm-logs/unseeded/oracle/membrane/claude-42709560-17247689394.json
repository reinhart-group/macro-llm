Exploring slight variations in the distribution of A's and B's, especially in the middle and at the very end of the sequence.\n3. Investigating whether minor changes to the alternating pattern or grouping of A's can yield improvements.\n\nWe're now heavily exploiting the patterns that have shown success, while still including some exploration to avoid getting stuck in a local minimum. Each proposal is unique and builds upon the insights from our best performers, with a focus on making subtle changes to try to fine-tune our best solution. As we're getting closer to our target of less than 1.34, we're making even more nuanced adjustments in an attempt to bridge the final gap."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nABABAAABAAABAAABABBB: 7.283\nABABAAABAAAAAABABAAB: 4.994\nABABAAABAAAAAAAABBBA: 9.295\nABBBAAABAAAABABABBAB: 5.093\nABABABAABAABAAABABBB: 10.951\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.

Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
