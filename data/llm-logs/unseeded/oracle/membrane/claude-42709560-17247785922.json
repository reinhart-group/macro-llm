This explores whether a slight redistribution of 'A's can improve the already good result.\n\nThese proposals aim to balance exploitation of our previously successful sequences with careful exploration. We're revisiting our best-known solution to confirm its performance, while also introducing controlled variations based on our recent good result to understand which elements are most critical to achieving a low distance.\n\nBy focusing on sequences that have performed well and making small, strategic changes, we hope to either confirm our earlier excellent results or potentially uncover new insights about the solution space. This approach allows us to systematically explore around our best-known sequences while avoiding getting stuck in less promising areas."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nAAABBBABBAAAABBABAAA: 4.557\nAAABBBABBAAAABBBAABA: 3.136\nAAABBBABBAAAABAAAABA: 3.574\nAAABBBAABAAAABBAABAA: 0.784\nAAABBBABBAAABBBABAAA: 5.440\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions. Please propose five new 20-character sequences (12 'A', 8 'B') that build upon the insights from these results to yield distances closer to the target. Remember to: 1. Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
