We've avoided duplicating any previously evaluated sequences and have aimed to balance exploitation of promising patterns with exploration of new arrangements.\n\nThe focus remains on refining our best-performing sequences while still introducing some variety to prevent getting stuck in local optima. We're particularly interested in the placement of 'B's in the latter half of the sequence, as this seems to have a significant impact on the distance metric.\n\nWe're exploring both slight variations of our best performers and more subtle changes in the distribution of 'B's, especially towards the end of the sequence. This approach allows us to thoroughly explore the solution space around our best performers while also searching for potentially better solutions in nearby areas.\n\nBy including our two best performers so far (0.167 and 0.734) along with three new variations, we're aiming to either confirm their optimality or discover even better solutions in their immediate vicinity."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nAABAAABBAAAABABBBABA: 0.835\nAABAAABBAABAABABBABA: 8.080\nAABAAABBAAAAABABBBBA: 0.068\nAABAAABBAAAAABABAABB: 0.928\nAABAAABBAAAAABBABBBA: 0.326\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
