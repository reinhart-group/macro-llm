We're exploring if a more balanced distribution can improve the outcome.\n\nThese proposals continue to exploit the patterns that have shown promise, particularly the \"ABABABAABAAAA\" and \"AAABABAABAAAA\" starts from our best performers, while also exploring subtle variations. We're focusing on fine-tuning the distribution of 'A's and 'B's, especially in the latter half of the sequences, as these areas seem to be where small changes can make significant differences.\n\nWe're balancing between maintaining the successful patterns at the start and exploring different arrangements in the latter part of the sequences. This approach aims to further refine our results while still maintaining some exploration to avoid getting trapped in local minima and to potentially find a sequence that breaks the 1.34 threshold."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nABABABAABAAAABABBAAB: 5.963\nAAABABAABAAAABBBAABA: 1.009\nAAABABAABAAAABABBAAA: 1.080\nABABABAABAAAABABBABB: 4.536\nAAABABAABAAABBBBAABA: 3.395\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.

Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
