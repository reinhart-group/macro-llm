We've made good progress with two sequences now falling under the 1.34 threshold. Let's refine our approach based on these new insights.\n\n1. ABBAABABABAABBABAAAB:\nRationale: This is our previous best performer (0.540). We're including it again to ensure it's directly compared with our new variations and to confirm its performance.\n\n2. ABBBABABABAABBABAAAA:\nRationale: This is a slight modification of the second-best performer from the last batch (0.920), changing the last 'B' to an 'A'. We're exploring if this small change can further improve the distance.\n\n3. ABAABABABAABBABAAABB:\nRationale: This is a variation of the third-best performer from the last batch (1.094), moving the last 'A' to the second position and adding a 'B' at the end. We're testing if this subtle change can push it below the 0.920 threshold.\n\n4. ABBABABABAABBABAAABA:\nRationale: This sequence maintains the successful 'ABBA' start and 'AAABA' end but slightly adjusts the middle part of the sequence. We're exploring if this new arrangement can yield even better results.\n\n5. BABBABABABAABBABAAAB:\nRationale: This sequence starts with 'BABBA' instead of 'ABBA', but keeps the successful middle and end parts of our best performers. We're testing if this different start can still produce a good distance while adding some diversity to our search.\n\nChain-of-thought reasoning:\na. The 'ABBA' or 'ABBB' start seems to be performing well, so we're maintaining this in most proposals with slight variations.\nb. The 'ABABA' pattern in the middle continues to appear crucial for good performance, so we're keeping this consistent across all proposals.\nc. The 'BABAAAB' or 'BAAABA' end parts seem to be performing well, so we're focusing on these in most proposals.\nd. We're balancing exploitation of our best results (proposals 1-4) with some exploration (proposal 5) to continue improving while avoiding local optima.\ne. Small changes, especially at the beginning and end of the sequence, seem to have a significant impact on the distance, so we're focusing on fine-tuning these areas.\n\nThese proposals aim to refine our best-performing sequences while still testing some new arrangements.
