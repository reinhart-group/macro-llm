We're focusing heavily on sequences that start with 'BABAAA' or 'BABAAA', have a cluster of five 'B's, and end with various arrangements of 'A's and 'B's, as these patterns have shown good performance.\n\nWe're introducing subtle variations in the arrangement of 'A's and 'B's, particularly towards the end of the sequences. These proposals maintain the overall structure that has been successful but explore small changes that might push us even closer to the optimal solution.\n\nWe're also trying to balance exploitation of the best-performing patterns with exploration of nearby solution spaces. Given that we've found a solution with a distance of 1.006, which is below the 1.34 threshold, these proposals focus on fine-tuning this pattern to see if we can achieve even better results.\n\nThe goal is to find a sequence that consistently yields a very low distance while also ensuring we haven't missed any potential improvements in the immediate vicinity of our best solutions."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nBABAAABABBBBBBBBAABA: 1.023\nBABAAABABBBBBBBBAABB: 2.655\nBABAABBABBBBBBBBAABB: 2.649\nBABAABBABBABBBBBAABB: 2.635\nBABAABBBBBABBBBBAABB: 2.607\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
