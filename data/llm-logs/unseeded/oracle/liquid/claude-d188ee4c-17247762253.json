AABAABAABAABAABAAABB:\nRationale: The best performing sequence from the previous batch (9.007) had a repeating 'AABAA' pattern.

Examining if changes to the beginning of the sequence while maintaining the successful end can yield good results.\n\nBy focusing on these small variations, we hope to either find an even better solution or confirm that we've reached the optimal sequence. The introduction of a 'C' in one sequence is a more exploratory move to ensure we're not missing any potential improvements by limiting ourselves to just 'A's and 'B's."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nABABBAABAABABAABABAA: 3.470\nABABBAABAABABAABBBAB: 1.030\nABABBAABAABAABABABAB: 1.276\nBAABBAABAABABAABABAB: 0.836\nABABBAABAABABBABABAB: 1.167\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.

Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
