I've placed more 'A's at the beginning and end, as the best performing sequence from the initial batch (3.672) had this characteristic.\n\n2.

It's quite different from the initial batch to explore a new region of the solution space.\n\n3. ABAAABAAABAAABAAABBB: \nReasoning: This sequence uses a repeating pattern of \"ABAAAB\" which allows for regular spacing of 'B's throughout the sequence, with a group of 'B's at the end.

AAAABBAAAAAABBBBAAAA: \nReasoning: This sequence groups 'A's and 'B's more extremely than the previous proposals, to explore if larger groupings might yield better results.
