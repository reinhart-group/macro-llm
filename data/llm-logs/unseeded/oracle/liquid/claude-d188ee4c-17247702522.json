I've placed more 'A's at the beginning and end, as the best performing sequence from the initial batch (3.672) had this characteristic.\n\n2. AAAABAABBBAAAABAABBB: \nReasoning: This sequence explores grouping 'A's and 'B's together more tightly, while still maintaining some alternation. It's quite different from the initial batch to explore a new region of the solution space.\n\n3. ABAAABAAABAAABAAABBB: \nReasoning: This sequence uses a repeating pattern of \"ABAAAB\" which allows for regular spacing of 'B's throughout the sequence, with a group of 'B's at the end. This is to test if evenly distributed 'B's with a concentration at one end performs well.\n\n4. AAAABBAAAAAABBBBAAAA: \nReasoning: This sequence groups 'A's and 'B's more extremely than the previous proposals, to explore if larger groupings might yield better results. It maintains 'A's at the start and end, which seemed beneficial in the initial batch.\n\n5.
