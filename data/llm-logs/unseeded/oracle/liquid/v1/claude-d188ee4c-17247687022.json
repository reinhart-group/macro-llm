It's quite different from the initial batch to explore a new region of the solution space.\n\n3. ABAAABAAABAAABAAABBB: \nReasoning: This sequence uses a repeating pattern of \"ABAAAB\" which allows for regular spacing of 'B's throughout the sequence, with a group of 'B's at the end. This is to test if evenly distributed 'B's with a concentration at one end performs well.\n\n4.

We're focusing heavily on exploitation now that we have multiple good solutions, but still including some exploration to avoid getting stuck in a local optimum. All sequences maintain the required 12 'A's and 8 'B's and avoid duplicating any previously evaluated sequences. \n\nThe goal is to fine-tune our search in the most promising area of the solution space we've discovered so far, while still allowing for the possibility of finding an even better solution through slight variations. We're particularly focusing on the \"BAABA\" start and the \"BABABA\" middle section that have appeared in many good solutions, while exploring different endings and slight redistributions of 'B's."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nBAABBABABAABABAABAAB: 0.695\nBAABABABAABABABAABBA: 1.359\nABAABABABAABABAABAAB: 0.890\nBAABABABAABABAAAAABA: 9.139\nBAABAAAABAABABABAABA: 6.782\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.

Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
