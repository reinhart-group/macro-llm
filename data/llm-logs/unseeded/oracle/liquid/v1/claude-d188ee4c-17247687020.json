The strategy continues to exploit the patterns from our best results while still introducing some exploration through small variations. Given that we've found solutions within the target range, these proposals aim to see if we can find an even better one or confirm that we've found the optimal arrangement. We're making fine-tuned adjustments to probe the immediate solution space around our most successful sequences."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nBABABAABABABBAABAAAA: 18.376\nBABABAABABABBAABABAB: 1.743\nBABAAAABABABBAABAABA: 3.435\nBABABAABABABBABBAAAA: 19.129\nBABABAABAAABBAABAABB: 6.822\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions. Please propose five new 20-character sequences (12 'A', 8 'B') that build upon the insights from these results to yield distances closer to the target. Remember to: 1. Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
