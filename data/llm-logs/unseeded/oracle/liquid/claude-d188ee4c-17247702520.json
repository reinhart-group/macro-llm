We're continuing to focus on the \"ABAABA\" and \"BBB\" patterns that appear in our most successful sequence, as well as the overall balance and positioning of 'A's and 'B's.\n\nThe exploration is more refined in this round, given that we've found an excellent solution, but we're still testing variations to see if we can improve further or find alternative good solutions. We're particularly interested in seeing how small changes to the most successful pattern affect the distance metric, and if we can push our best result even lower than 0.353.\n\nWe're also maintaining some diversity in our proposals to avoid getting stuck in a local minimum, while still leveraging the insights gained from our successful sequences. The goal is to find the optimal arrangement of these successful patterns within the 20-character sequence."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nABAABABBBABAABABBAAA: 8.415\nABAABABBBABAABABBABA: 0.820\nABABABBBABAABABBAABA: 0.749\nABAABABBBABAABAABABA: 1.675\nABAABABBBABAABAABAAB: 0.895\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.

Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
