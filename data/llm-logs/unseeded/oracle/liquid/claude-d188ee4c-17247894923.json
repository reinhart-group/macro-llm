The last two proposals introduce a bit more variation to ensure we're not overlooking potentially better solutions in nearby areas of the solution space.\n\nBy balancing exploitation of our best results with some continued exploration, we hope to either find an even better solution or confirm that we've found the optimal area in the solution space. Our goal remains to find sequences with distances as close to zero as possible."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nBAABAABABAABAABABABA: 1.124\nBAABAABABAABAABABABB: 1.611\nBAABAABAABABAABAABAA: 4.072\nBAABAABABAABAABAABAB: 0.096\nBAABABAABAABAABAABAB: 0.968\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions. Please propose five new 20-character sequences (12 'A', 8 'B') that build upon the insights from these results to yield distances closer to the target. Remember to: 1. Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
