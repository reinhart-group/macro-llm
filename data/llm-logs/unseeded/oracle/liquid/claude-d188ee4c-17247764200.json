We're exploring whether slight shifts in these positions can yield improvements or provide more insights into what makes these patterns effective.\n\nWe're also balancing between heavily exploiting our current best solution (starting with 'BAABA' and containing 'ABABA' near the end) and exploring minor variations. This strategy aims to potentially find an even better solution while also gathering more information about the sensitivity of the distance metric to small changes in the sequence.\n\nGiven that we're in the final stages of optimization and have found very good solutions, these proposals are more focused on fine-tuning and less on broad exploration compared to earlier iterations. We're also revisiting a previously successful sequence to ensure we don't overlook any potential improvements and to compare its performance with our current best."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nBAABABAABAABABABAABB: 0.913\nBAABABAABAABABAAABBA: 1.283\nBABBABAABAABABABAABA: 3.265\nBABBBBAABAABABABAABA: 3.261\nBAABAABABABBABAAABAB: 1.496\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
