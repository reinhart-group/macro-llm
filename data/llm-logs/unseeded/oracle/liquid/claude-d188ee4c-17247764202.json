Based on these results, I'll propose five new sequences for the next iteration, considering the guidelines you've provided.\n\n1. AAABBBAAABAAABAAABBA: \nReasoning: This sequence starts with a pattern of alternating groups of 'A's and 'B's, which seems to yield lower distances based on the initial batch. I've placed more 'A's at the beginning and end, as the best performing sequence from the initial batch (3.672) had this characteristic.\n\n2. AAAABAABBBAAAABAABBB: \nReasoning: This sequence explores grouping 'A's and 'B's together more tightly, while still maintaining some alternation. It's quite different from the initial batch to explore a new region of the solution space.\n\n3. ABAAABAAABAAABAAABBB: \nReasoning: This sequence uses a repeating pattern of \"ABAAAB\" which allows for regular spacing of 'B's throughout the sequence, with a group of 'B's at the end. This is to test if evenly distributed 'B's with a concentration at one end performs well.\n\n4. AAAABBAAAAAABBBBAAAA: \nReasoning: This sequence groups 'A's and 'B's more extremely than the previous proposals, to explore if larger groupings might yield better results. It maintains 'A's at the start and end, which seemed beneficial in the initial batch.\n\n5. ABAABABAABAABABAABAA: \nReasoning: This sequence uses a very regular alternating pattern of \"ABA\" and \"AB\", which is different from all previous proposals. This is to explore if a highly regular pattern throughout the entire sequence might perform well.\n\nThese proposals aim to balance exploitation of promising patterns seen in the initial batch (such as 'A's at the start and end) with exploration of new patterns and groupings.
