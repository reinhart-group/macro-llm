ABBAAAAABABABBABABA\nRationale: Our best performer (6.522) started with 'ABB', had 4 'A's in the central cluster, followed by 'ABABABBABABABB'. This proposal maintains that start and central 'A' cluster but adjusts the ending slightly to explore if this can improve the result.\n\n2. ABBAAAABABABABABABA\nRationale: This is similar to our best performer, but we're reducing the number of consecutive 'B's and extending the alternating 'ABABA' pattern at the end to see if a more consistent alternation yields better results.\n\n3. BAAAAABBBABBABABABA\nRationale: This sequence is based on our second-best performer (6.710), but changes the ending to match the alternating pattern that has been successful in other sequences.\n\n4. ABBAAAAABABBABABABA\nRationale: This proposal keeps the 'ABB' start of our best performer but increases the central 'A' cluster by one and adjusts the following pattern, to test if a longer 'A' sequence in the middle improves the result.\n\n5. ABBAAAABABABBABABABAB\nRationale: This sequence is very similar to our best performer, but adds a 'B' at the end. To maintain the correct A/B ratio, we'll remove an 'A' from the central cluster: ABBAAAAABABBABABABAB\n\nThese proposals continue to refine the patterns that have shown the most promise, particularly:\n\n1. Starting with 'ABB' or 'BAA'\n2. Maintaining a substantial central 'A' cluster (4-5 'A's)\n3. Having a pattern of alternating 'A's and 'B's or small groups of 'B's following the central 'A' cluster\n4. Ending with an alternating 'ABABA' pattern\n\nWe're making very fine adjustments now, focusing on:\n\n1. The exact length of the central 'A' cluster\n2. The pattern immediately following the central 'A' cluster\n3. The presence and position of small 'B' groups (BB or BBB)\n4. The specific alternating pattern at the end of the sequence\n\nBy exploring these subtle variations, we aim to find the optimal arrangement that might push us below the 1.34 threshold. We're still maintaining some variety in our proposals to avoid getting trapped in a local minimum, but we're really honing in on the most promising area of the solution space based on our best results so far."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nABBAAAAABABBABABABAB: 9.818\nABBAAAAABABBAAABABAB: 10.749\nABBAAAAAAABBAAABABAB: 10.246\nABBAAAAAAABBAABBABAB: 11.534\nABBAAAAAAABBAABAABAB: 9.975\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
