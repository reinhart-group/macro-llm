We've made excellent progress with two sequences showing distances less than 1.34, and one very close to that threshold. I'll propose five new sequences that aim to refine these successful patterns while also exploring some new variations.\n\n1. ABBABABAABAABAABAABA\n\nRationale: This sequence is based on the best-performing sequence (0.822) but replaces one 'BB' pair with two separate 'B' monomers. This subtle change might further optimize the balance of attractive and repulsive interactions while maintaining the overall successful pattern.\n\n2. ABAABABBAABAABAABAAA\n\nRationale: Inspired by the second-best sequence (0.904), this variation keeps most of the sequence identical but replaces the final 'B' with an 'A'. This might create a slightly different end-group behavior that could potentially improve the morphology.\n\n3. ABBABABAABAABBABAABB\n\nRationale: This sequence is based on the best-performing one but moves two 'B' monomers to the end. This change in end-group composition might affect the overall assembly process and potentially enhance the formation of amorphous liquid droplets.\n\n4. ABAABABBAABAABABAABA\n\nRationale: This sequence combines elements from the two best-performing sequences, maintaining the 'ABAA' and 'ABBA' motifs but in a slightly different arrangement. This new combination might create interesting local environments that promote the desired morphology.\n\n5. ABBABAABAABAABBABAAB\n\nRationale: While still maintaining similarities to the successful sequences, this variation introduces a different distribution of 'BB' pairs throughout the sequence. This might create a more varied landscape of interaction strengths along the polymer chain, potentially influencing the self-assembly process.\n\nThese sequences aim to exploit the success of the previous batches while introducing subtle variations to explore nearby regions of the sequence space.
