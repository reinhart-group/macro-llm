Let's build upon this success while also exploring nearby sequence space.\n\n1. ABAABAABABABABABAABA:\nRationale: This sequence is a slight modification of our new best performer. We've moved the last 'A' to create an 'ABA' end instead of 'BAA'. This might fine-tune the balance of attractive and repulsive interactions at the chain end while maintaining the successful overall structure.\n\n2.

ABAABAABABABABABAABA:\nRationale: Another variation on our best sequence, this proposal breaks up the long 'BABABA' stretch with an 'ABA' segment near the end.

ABAABABABAABABABABAA:\nRationale: This sequence is similar to our best performer but introduces a small 'ABA' disruption in the middle of the 'BABABA' stretch.
