We've made excellent progress with ABBAABAABABABABAAABB achieving a distance of 0.193, which is our best result so far. Let's build upon this success while also exploring nearby solution space.\n\n1. ABBAABAABABABABAABBA\nRationale: This sequence is a slight modification of our best performer. We've swapped the positions of the last two monomers, creating an 'ABBA' end. This might create an interesting balance of interactions at the terminus while maintaining the highly successful core structure.\n\n2. ABBAABAABAABABABABAA\nRationale: This sequence maintains the successful 'ABBAA' start of our best performer but redistributes some of the 'B' monomers towards the end. This might create a more gradual transition between attractive and repulsive regions along the polymer chain.\n\n3. AABBAABAABABABABAABB\nRationale: We've added an 'A' to the beginning of our best performer and moved a 'B' to the end. This might promote initial aggregation while still maintaining the successful core pattern that led to good results.\n\n4. ABBAABABAABABABABAAB\nRationale: This sequence introduces a slight variation in the middle section of our best performer by breaking up the 'BABABA' pattern with an additional 'AA' pair. This might create more diverse local structures that could enhance amorphous droplet formation.\n\n5.
