We've made excellent progress with two sequences achieving distances below 1.34, particularly the outstanding result of 0.251. Let's build upon these insights to propose five new sequences.\n\n1. ABAABAABAABABAABBABA\n\nRationale: This sequence is based on our best performer (0.251) but with the last 'B' and 'A' swapped. This slight modification explores how changing the terminal arrangement affects the overall morphology while maintaining the highly successful core structure.\n\n2.
