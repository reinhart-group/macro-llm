The 'B' monomers are more evenly distributed in the latter half, which might promote the formation of heterogeneous, worm-like structures.\n\n2.

AAAAABAAABABBAABABBA:\nRationale: We're testing a sequence with a longer initial 'A' cluster followed by a more mixed region. This could potentially allow for strong initial aggregation followed by the formation of a more heterogeneous structure along the length of the micelle.\n\nThese sequences aim to balance the exploitation of promising features from the previous best-performing sequence (like the initial 'AAAAA' cluster) with exploration of new patterns that might lead to the desired worm-like micelle aggregates.

We've made excellent progress with three sequences below the 1.34 threshold. Let's continue to refine our approach based on these insights:\n\n1. AAAAABBBABAABAABBABA:\nRationale: This sequence is a slight modification of our best performer (AAAAABBBABAABAABBABB), swapping the positions of the last two monomers. This might create a subtly different tail structure while maintaining the highly successful core and overall pattern.\n\n2. AAAAABBBABAABAABBBAB:\nRationale: We're revisiting this sequence as it has performed well in previous iterations. It combines elements from our successful sequences and is worth testing again for consistency.\n\n3. AAAAABBBABAABABABABA:\nRationale: Building on the success of our third-best performer (AAAAABBBABAABABABABB), we've adjusted the tail region to end with 'ABA'. This could potentially create a more flexible end to the micelle while maintaining the successful core structure.\n\n4.
