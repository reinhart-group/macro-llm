It's encouraging to see that AAAAABBBBAAAABAABABB performed very well with a distance of 0.445, and AAAAABBBBBAAABABBAAB also produced a good solution with a distance of 0.704. Let's use these insights to propose five new sequences:\n\n1. AAAAABBBBAAAAABABABB\nRationale: This sequence is very similar to the best performer but swaps the positions of two 'B' monomers in the latter half. This minor change might fine-tune the balance between hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions in the worm-like structure.\n\n2. AAAAABBBBAAAABABAABB\nRationale: This sequence maintains the successful \"AAAAABBBB\" start but slightly reorders the latter half, introducing more alternating 'AB' units. This might enhance the heterogeneity of the worm-like structure while preserving the favorable core distribution.\n\n3. AAAAABBBBBAAABAABBAB\nRationale: This sequence combines elements from both good performers, with a longer 'B' block in the middle and the successful end distribution. This might promote stronger hydrophobic interactions in the core while maintaining the effective end structure.\n\n4. AAAAABBBBAAABABAABAB\nRationale: This sequence introduces more frequent alternation of 'A' and 'B' monomers in the latter half. This might create multiple \"pinch points\" in the structure, potentially increasing the heterogeneity of the worm-like micelles.\n\n5.
