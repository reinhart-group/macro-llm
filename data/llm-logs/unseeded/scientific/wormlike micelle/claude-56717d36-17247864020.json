We're seeing significant improvement, with the last two sequences getting much closer to our target distance. Let's build upon these insights to propose new sequences that might push us below the 1.34 threshold.\n\n1. AAAABBABABABBBAAABAB:\nRationale: This sequence combines elements from our two best performers, maintaining the \"AAAABBA\" start and incorporating more alternating A-B patterns in the middle. This might enhance the heterogeneity of the worm-like structure while preserving the strong hydrophobic core initiation.\n\n2. AAAAABBABABAABBABBBB:\nRationale: Building on the success of the sequence starting with five A's, this proposal introduces more frequent A-B alternations in the middle, potentially promoting a more heterogeneous structure along the micelle's length.\n\n3. AAAABBAABABAABBBABAB:\nRationale: This sequence maintains the successful \"AAAABBAA\" start but introduces a new pattern in the middle with more frequent A-B alternations, followed by a \"BBB\" segment. This arrangement might create interesting curvatures or segments in the worm-like structure.\n\n4. AAAABBABABAAABBABBBB:\nRationale: Combining elements from our top performers, this sequence aims to balance strong initial hydrophobic interactions with increased heterogeneity in the middle, followed by a hydrophobic tail.\n\n5. AAAAABABABBAABBABBAB:\nRationale: This sequence explores a different distribution of A and B monomers while maintaining some successful elements. The early cluster of A's might initiate strong micelle formation, while the mixed middle and end sections could promote heterogeneity along the length of the aggregate.\n\nThese proposals continue to balance exploitation of successful patterns (particularly the \"AAAABBA\" or \"AAAAAB\" starts and the increased A-B alternations in the middle) with exploration of new arrangements.
