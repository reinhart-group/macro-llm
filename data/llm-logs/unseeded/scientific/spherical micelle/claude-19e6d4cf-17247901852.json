We now have two sequences below the 1.34 threshold, with AAAAAAAABABABABABBAB (1.041) performing the best.

AAAAAAAABABABABABABB:\nRationale: This sequence is very similar to our best performer but moves the last 'B' to the end. This minor adjustment might fine-tune the micelle's surface properties while maintaining the successful overall structure.\n\n2.
