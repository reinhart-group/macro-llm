It seems we've hit a plateau, with AAAABAAABABABABBBABB performing the best among this batch. Let's use these insights to propose five new sequences that might help us break through to the target distance of less than 1.34:\n\n1. AAAABAAABABABABBBBAB\nRationale: This sequence is very similar to the best performer but moves the 'BBBB' cluster one position towards the end. This slight adjustment might fine-tune the micelle surface properties while maintaining the successful core and interface structure.\n\n2. AAAABAAABABABBABBABB\nRationale: This sequence maintains the successful 'AAAA' start and alternating 'ABAB' pattern but distributes the 'B' monomers more evenly in the latter half. This might create a more gradual transition from the hydrophobic core to the hydrophilic shell.\n\n3. AAAABAAABABBABBBABAB\nRationale: This sequence keeps the 'ABBA' motif that has been successful in previous iterations and introduces a 'BBB' cluster slightly earlier. This might create a more defined repulsive region while still maintaining a structured interface.\n\n4. AAAABAAABABABABABBBA\nRationale: Building on the success of the alternating 'ABAB' pattern, this sequence ends with a 'BBBA' motif. This might influence the micelle surface curvature and inter-micelle interactions, potentially leading to more uniform spherical shapes.\n\n5. AAAABAAABABABBBABABB\nRationale: This sequence combines elements from several previous good performers. It maintains the successful start, incorporates a consistent 'ABAB' pattern, includes a 'BBB' cluster, and ends with 'ABB'. This balanced approach might optimize the core-shell structure and micelle separation.\n\nThese sequences aim to exploit the successful features of the previous best-performing sequences while introducing subtle variations that might push us closer to the target. They all maintain:\n\n1. The 'AAAA' start, which is crucial for core formation.\n2. A significant portion of alternating 'AB' pairs, which seem to contribute to good performance.\n3. Strategic placement of 'B' clusters to influence micelle separation and shape.\n\nThe variations focus on:\n\n1. Fine-tuning the balance between alternating 'AB' pairs and 'B' clusters.\n2. Exploring different positions for the 'BBB' or 'BBBB' motifs within the sequence.\n3. Adjusting the end of the sequence to potentially influence surface properties and inter-micelle interactions.\n\nThese proposals aim to optimize:\n\n1.

We're seeing consistent performance with the best sequences having distances around 2.8. Let's use these insights to propose five new sequences that might help us break through to the target distance of less than 1.34:\n\n1. AAAABAAABABABBBABBAB\nRationale: This sequence combines elements from the two best performers (AAAABAAABABABABBBBAB and AAAABAAABABABBBABABB). It maintains the successful 'AAAA' start, the alternating 'ABAB' pattern, and the 'BBB' cluster, but slightly adjusts the position of the final 'B' monomers.

AAAABAAABABBABABBBAB\nRationale: This sequence introduces an 'ABBA' motif earlier in the sequence while maintaining the overall distribution of 'A' and 'B' monomers that has performed well. This might create a more complex core-shell interface that could lead to the desired morphology.\n\n4. AAAABAAABABABABBBABA\nRationale: Similar to the best performers, but with a slight adjustment at the end (switching the final 'B' to 'A'). This minor change might influence the micelle surface curvature and inter-micelle interactions, potentially leading to more uniform spherical shapes.\n\n5. AAAABAAABABABBBBAABA\nRationale: This sequence explores a different distribution of the 'B' cluster, placing four 'B' monomers together followed by alternating 'ABA'.
