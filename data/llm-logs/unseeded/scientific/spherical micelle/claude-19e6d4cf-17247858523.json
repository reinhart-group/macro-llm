We've made excellent progress, with AAAAAAAAABAABBABBBBB performing exceptionally well with a distance of 0.244. Let's use these insights to propose five new sequences:\n\n1. AAAAAAAAAABABABBBBBB:\nRationale: This sequence is similar to our best performer but shifts the 'BA' motif one position to the right. This might fine-tune the transition between the core and shell regions.\n\n2. AAAAAAAAABAABBABBABB:\nRationale: This sequence combines elements from our two best performers (AAAAAAAAABAABBABBBBB and AAAAAAAAAAAABBABBABB). It maintains the successful 'ABAABBA' motif but modifies the end to include the 'BBABB' pattern.\n\n3. AAAAAAAABAAABBABBBBB:\nRationale: This sequence moves the first 'B' one position to the left compared to our best performer. It explores whether a slightly earlier transition from core to shell might improve the morphology.\n\n4. AAAAAAAAABAABBBABBBB:\nRationale: This sequence keeps the successful 'ABAAB' motif but rearranges the 'B' monomers at the end. This might create a different shell structure while maintaining the effective core-shell transition.\n\n5. AAAAAAAAAABAABBABBBB:\nRationale: This sequence moves the 'BA' motif two positions to the right compared to our best performer. It explores whether a larger pure 'A' core with a more concentrated 'B' shell might yield good results.\n\nThese proposals are guided by the following principles and observations:\n\n1.
