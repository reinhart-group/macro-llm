We're making significant progress with our best sequence now at 3.616. Let's propose five new sequences that aim to further refine our approach:\n\n1. AAAABAABAABABABBBABA:\nRationale: This sequence is a slight modification of the best-performing sequence (3.616). We've moved the last 'B' to the end, which might help create a more defined micelle boundary while maintaining the successful core structure.\n\n2. AAAABAABAABABABBABBB:\nRationale: Another variation of the best sequence, moving the \"BBB\" segment to the end. This might affect the micelle closure and potentially lead to a more uniform spherical shape.\n\n3. AAAABAABAABABBAABBBB:\nRationale: We're maintaining the successful start but exploring a new arrangement of 'B' monomers towards the end. Clustering four 'B' monomers at the end might create a strong hydrophilic region that could influence the overall micelle structure.\n\n4. AAAABAABAABBBABABABB:\nRationale: This sequence keeps the \"BBB\" segment from the best performer but adjusts its position slightly. The alternating 'AB' at the end might provide a more gradual transition in hydrophobicity.\n\n5. AAAABAABABAABABBABBB:\nRationale: While still starting with \"AAAABA\", this sequence explores a different distribution of 'A' and 'B' monomers in the middle. This might affect the folding dynamics and potentially improve the overall micelle structure.\n\nKey considerations in these proposals:\n\n1. All sequences maintain the successful \"AAAABAA\" start, which has consistently contributed to lower distances.\n2. We're exploring variations of the best-performing sequence (3.616) to see if we can further optimize its structure.\n3. The distribution and clustering of 'B' monomers are being varied to explore their impact on micelle formation and shape.\n4.
