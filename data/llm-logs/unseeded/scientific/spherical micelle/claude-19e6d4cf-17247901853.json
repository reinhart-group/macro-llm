It's encouraging to see that we have three sequences meeting the criteria for good solutions, with AAAAAAAAAAAABBAABBBB performing the best at 0.797. Let's build upon these insights to propose five new sequences:\n\n1. AAAAAAAAAAAABBAABBBA:\nRationale: This sequence is very similar to our best performer but swaps the last 'B' for an 'A'. This minor change might fine-tune the repulsive shell structure while maintaining the excellent core formation.\n\n2. AAAAAAAAAAAABBAAABBB:\nRationale: This sequence keeps the same initial structure as our best performer but rearranges the last five monomers. This could potentially create a slightly different repulsive shell structure that might improve micelle uniformity.\n\n3. AAAAAAAAAAABBAABBBB:\nRationale: This sequence reduces the initial 'A' block by one monomer compared to our best performer. This slight change might allow for a bit more flexibility in the core, potentially leading to a more uniform overall structure.\n\n4. AAAAAAAAAAAABBABBAAB:\nRationale: This sequence maintains the large 'A' block at the start but introduces a different pattern of 'B' and 'A' monomers at the end. This could potentially create a unique repulsive shell structure that might enhance the spherical shape.\n\n5. AAAAAAAAAAAABABABABA:\nRationale: This sequence is inspired by our third-best performer (AAAAAAAAAAAABABABABB) but ends with an 'A' instead of a 'B'. The alternating 'B' and 'A' monomers at the end might create a more uniform repulsive shell.\n\nThese proposals continue to exploit the success of sequences with a large block of 'A' monomers followed by a mix of 'B' and 'A' monomers, which has proven effective in promoting the desired core-shell structure of spherical micelles.
