We've found an even better solution with ABBAAAAAAAAAAABBABAB, achieving a distance of 0.680. This is a significant improvement. Let's continue to refine our approach based on these results, focusing on exploiting this success while also exploring nearby variations.\n\n1. ABBAAAAAAAAAAABBABAA:\nRationale: This sequence is very similar to our best performer, with only the last 'B' changed to 'A'. This slight modification might create a different balance in the repulsive interactions at the end, potentially leading to even more uniform micelles.\n\n2. ABBAAAAAAAAAAABABBAB:\nRationale: This sequence maintains the successful 'ABB' start and long 'A' block, but slightly rearranges the end sequence. This might create a different pattern of repulsive interactions at the micelle surface, potentially fine-tuning the overall structure.\n\n3. ABBAAAAAAAAAAAABABAB:\nRationale: This sequence extends the central 'A' block by one monomer while keeping the successful 'ABB' start and 'ABABAB' end. This slight change in the hydrophobic core might influence the micelle size and uniformity.\n\n4. ABBAAAAAAAAAAABBABBA:\nRationale: This sequence is very similar to our best performer, but ends with 'BA' instead of 'AB'. This subtle change might affect the surface properties of the micelle while maintaining the overall successful structure.\n\n5. ABBAAAAAAAAAABABABAB:\nRationale: This sequence introduces a longer alternating 'ABAB' pattern at the end while maintaining the successful 'ABB' start and long 'A' block.
