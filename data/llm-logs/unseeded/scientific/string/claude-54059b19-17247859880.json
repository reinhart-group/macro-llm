AABBABBAAAAABABBBAA:\nRationale: This sequence keeps the successful 'AABBABBAAAAA' start from our current best performer but modifies the end to 'BABBBAA'. This explores how a different end configuration might affect the overall string-like structure.\n\n4. AAABABBABAAAABABBABA:\nRationale: This sequence revisits one of our previously successful patterns. Given that our recent modifications haven't yielded better results, it's worth re-exploring this configuration to see if it still performs well.\n\n5. AABBABBAAAAAABABABA:\nRationale: This is a slight modification of our current best performer, removing one 'B' from the end. This might allow for more attractive interactions at the end of the chain while maintaining the successful overall pattern.\n\nThese sequences are designed to balance exploitation of our current best performer with exploration of slightly different patterns. We're focusing on:\n\n1. Maintaining the successful 'AABBABBAAAAA' or similar patterns in the first half of the sequence, which seems to be important for achieving the desired morphology.\n2. Exploring different distributions of 'A' and 'B' beads in the latter half of the sequence.\n3. Fine-tuning the balance between attractive and repulsive interactions, especially at the ends of the chain.\n\nBy proposing these sequences, we aim to optimize the balance between attractive interactions (promoted by 'A' clusters) and repulsive interactions (promoted by 'B' beads) that lead to the desired string-like structures. We're particularly interested in how small changes in the distribution of 'A' and 'B' beads affect the overall aggregation behavior.\n\nAs we continue, we'll keep refining our approach based on the performance of these sequences, with the goal of finding more solutions that fall below the 1.34 distance threshold and potentially improving upon our best results from previous iterations."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired morphology:\nAABBABBAAAAAABABBAAA: 1.742\nAABBABBBBAAAABABBABA: 6.280\nAABBABBAAAAAAAABBABA: 5.911\nBAABABBAAAAAABABBABA: 3.901\nAAABABBABABAABABBABA: 11.336\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.

It seems we're still struggling to find sequences that perform as well as our previous best. Let's take a step back and try to combine insights from our current and previous successful sequences. Here are five new proposals:\n\n1. AAABABBABAAAABABBABA:\nRationale: This sequence revisits our previously most successful pattern. Given that recent modifications haven't yielded better results, it's worth re-exploring this configuration to see if it still performs well in the context of our recent experiments.\n\n2. AABBABBAAAAAABABBAB:\nRationale: This sequence is very similar to our recent best performer (AABBABBAAAAAABABBABA), but with the last two beads swapped. This minor change might affect how the chain ends interact in the aggregate structure, potentially improving string-like characteristics.\n\n3. AAABABBBAAAAAABBABA:\nRationale: This sequence combines elements from our previous successful patterns. It starts with 'AAABABB', which was part of our best performers, followed by a longer stretch of 'A's, and ends with 'BBABA', which has also been present in good performers.\n\n4. AABABBABAAAABABBABA:\nRationale: This is a slight modification of our previously best-performing sequence, removing one 'A' from the beginning. This might allow for a bit more flexibility at the start of the chain while maintaining the overall successful pattern.\n\n5. AAABABBAAAAAABABBAA:\nRationale: This sequence maintains the 'AAABABB' start that has been successful, followed by a longer stretch of 'A's, and ends with 'BABBAA'. This explores a different end configuration while keeping elements that have worked well in the past.\n\nThese sequences are designed to balance exploitation of our previously successful patterns with exploration of slightly different configurations. We're focusing on:\n\n1. Revisiting and slightly modifying our previously most successful patterns, as recent explorations haven't yielded better results.\n2. Maintaining successful elements like 'AAABABB' or 'AABBABB' at the start of the sequence.\n3. Exploring different distributions of 'A' and 'B' beads in the latter half of the sequence, particularly at the ends.\n4. Balancing longer stretches of 'A's with strategic placement of 'B's to promote string-like structures.\n\nBy proposing these sequences, we aim to optimize the balance between attractive interactions (promoted by 'A' clusters) and repulsive interactions (promoted by 'B' beads) that lead to the desired string-like structures. We're particularly interested in how the distribution of 'A' and 'B' beads affects the overall aggregation behavior.\n\nAs we continue, we'll keep refining our approach based on the performance of these sequences, with the goal of finding more solutions that fall below the 1.34 distance threshold and potentially rediscovering or improving upon our best results from previous iterations."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired morphology:\nAAABABBABAAAABAABABA: 4.633\nAABBABBAAAAAABBBBABA: 1.123\nAAABABAABAAAABAABABA: 9.135\nAABBABBABAAAABABBABA: 4.535\nAAABABAABABAABAABABA: 16.215\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
