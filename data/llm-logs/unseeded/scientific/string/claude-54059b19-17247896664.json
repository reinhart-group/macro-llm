We're seeing significant improvement, with the best sequence now having a distance of 4.237. While we haven't reached the target of 1.34 yet, we're getting closer. Let's use these insights to refine our approach further. Here are five new sequences:\n\n1. AAABBAAABBAABBAABBA:\nRationale: This sequence is a slight modification of our best performer (AAABBAAABBAAABBAABBA). We've maintained the successful 'AAABBAAABB' start but adjusted the latter half to create a more symmetric pattern. This might promote more consistent string-like growth while maintaining the beneficial properties of the original sequence.\n\n2. AAABBBAAABAAABBAABBA:\nRationale: This sequence combines elements from our two best performers. We're using the 'AAABBB' start from the second-best sequence, followed by a pattern similar to our best sequence. This might create a strong initial repulsive section followed by alternating attractive and repulsive segments to guide string-like growth.\n\n3. AAABBAAABABAABBAABBA:\nRationale: We're exploring a variation of our best sequence by introducing more single 'B' monomers in the middle. This might create a more flexible central region, potentially allowing for better string-like arrangements while maintaining the successful end segments.\n\n4. BAABBAAABBAAABBAABAA:\nRationale: This sequence starts with 'BAABB', which might create an initial \"kink\" to guide string formation, followed by a pattern similar to our best-performing sequence. The slight variation at the end ('ABAA' instead of 'ABBA') might affect how the polymers connect to form larger structures.\n\n5. AAABBAABBAAABBAABBAA:\nRationale: We're trying a very regular 'AABB' repeat pattern here. This might create a series of evenly spaced attractive and repulsive segments, potentially promoting a consistent zig-zag conformation that could lead to string-like aggregates.\n\nIn the context of polymer self-assembly, these sequences are designed to balance attractive and repulsive forces in ways that might promote string-like aggregates. We're exploring how different patterns and distributions of 'A' and 'B' monomers can influence local interactions and overall morphology.\n\nKey principles applied in these designs:\n1. Maintaining successful elements from the best-performing sequences, particularly the 'AAABB' motif at the start.\n2. Creating patterns of 'A' and 'B' monomers that might induce specific conformations (like zig-zags) to promote string-like growth.\n3. Using 'B' monomers strategically to separate 'A' clusters and prevent excessive lateral aggregation.\n4. Exploring different distributions of 'A' and 'B' monomers throughout the sequences to potentially guide the overall structure towards a more linear, string-like morphology.\n5.

AAABBAABBAABBAABBAAB:\nRationale: This sequence is very similar to our best performer but with a slight shift in the pattern. The 'B' at the end might act as a \"cap\" to prevent excessive aggregation at the polymer ends, potentially promoting more linear growth.\n\n3. AABBAABBAABBAABBAAAA:\nRationale: We're exploring a variation of the successful 'AABB' repeat pattern, but starting and ending with different motifs. The 'AAAA' at the end might serve as a strong attraction point for end-to-end connections, potentially promoting longer string-like structures.\n\n4. AAABBAABBAAABBBAABBA:\nRationale: This sequence combines elements from our two best performers. We're using the 'AABB' repeat pattern but introducing a 'BBB' segment in the latter half.
