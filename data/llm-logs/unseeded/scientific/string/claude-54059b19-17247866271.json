We've made excellent progress with two sequences meeting the \"good solution\" criteria, particularly AAABBAABBAAAAABBABBA with a distance of 0.512. Let's build on these insights to propose five new sequences:\n\n1. AAABBAABBAAAAABBABAA:\nRationale: This sequence is a slight modification of our best performer (0.512). We've swapped the final 'B' with an 'A', which might enhance end-to-end interactions while maintaining the successful core structure.\n\n2. AAABBAABBAAAABABBABA:\nRationale: This sequence keeps the successful 'AAABBAABB' start but rearranges the latter half slightly. The alternating 'ABA' at the end might provide a balance between attraction and repulsion that could further optimize string-like formation.\n\n3. AABBAABBAAAAABBABBAA:\nRationale: This sequence is based on our second-best performer (0.949) but moves the final 'A' to the end. This might create a stronger attractive segment at both ends, potentially influencing the overall string-like morphology.\n\n4. AAAABBAABBAAAAABBABA:\nRationale: This sequence starts with an additional 'A' compared to our best performer. This might create an even stronger attractive segment at one end, potentially influencing the overall string-like morphology while maintaining the successful core structure.\n\n5. BAABBAABBAAAAABBABBA:\nRationale: This sequence explores the effect of starting with a 'B' monomer while maintaining the core of the successful sequence. This might create an interesting end effect that could influence the overall string-like morphology, potentially by reducing aggregation at one end.\n\nThese sequences are designed to exploit the success of our best performers while still exploring new possibilities.
