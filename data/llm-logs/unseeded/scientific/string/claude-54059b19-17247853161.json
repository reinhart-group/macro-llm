It starts with the successful 'AAAABBAABBAABAABAAB' pattern and adds an alternating 'AB' at the end, which might create a subtle kink that could further promote string-like structures.\n\n3. AAAABBAABBAABAABABBA:\nRationale: This sequence maintains the successful 'AAAABBAABBAA' start but modifies the end. The 'ABABBA' end segment might create a specific folding pattern that could enhance string-like assembly while still maintaining strong attractions at both ends.\n\n4. AAAABBAABAABAABAABBA:\nRationale: This sequence explores a different distribution of 'B' monomers in the middle while keeping the successful 'AAAA' start and 'AABBA' end. It aims to create a balance between attraction and repulsion that might favor string-like aggregates.\n\n5. AAAABBAABBAABABBAABA:\nRationale: This sequence keeps the successful 'AAAABBAABBAA' start but introduces a new pattern in the latter half. The 'BABBAABA' end might create a specific folding pattern that could promote string-like assembly.\n\nThese proposals aim to:\n1. Exploit the success of sequences starting with 'AAAABBAA' or 'AAAABBAB', which have shown great promise in recent iterations.\n2. Fine-tune the distribution of 'B' monomers, particularly in the latter half of the sequence, to find the optimal balance between attraction and repulsion.\n3. Maintain 'A'-rich starts and ends to promote strong initial and terminal attractions, which seem crucial for string-like assembly.\n4. Introduce controlled heterogeneity in the middle sections to prevent collapse into globular aggregates while promoting elongated structures.\n5. Create potential kinks or specific folding patterns that might facilitate the formation of string-like morphologies.\n\nBy refining these features and exploring subtle variations, we hope to make further progress towards achieving a distance below 1.34. We're focusing on fine-tuning the most successful patterns we've seen so far, while still introducing some variations to avoid getting stuck in a local minimum. The emphasis is on maintaining strong attractions at the start and end while carefully balancing the distribution of 'B' monomers to promote elongated, string-like structures."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired morphology:\nAAAABBAABBAABAABAABA: 8.200\nAAAABBAABBAABAABABBA: 4.486\nAAAABBAABAABAABAABBA: 6.025\nAAAABBAABBAABABBAABA: 5.633\nAAAABBBABBAABAABAABB: 3.870\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.

We're seeing continued progress, with the sequence AAAABBBABBAABAABAABB (3.870) performing the best in this batch. Let's use these insights to propose five new sequences that might bring us even closer to our target of string-like aggregates.\n\n1. AAAABBBABBAABAABAABA:\nRationale: This sequence is very similar to our best performer (3.870) but changes the last 'B' to 'A'. This might enhance end-to-end attractions while maintaining the overall successful structure, potentially promoting more extended string-like assemblies.\n\n2.
