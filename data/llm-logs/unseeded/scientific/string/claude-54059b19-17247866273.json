I've moved one 'A' bead towards the beginning to create a longer continuous stretch of 'A' beads in the middle, which might promote string-like aggregation.\n\n2.

We now have two more sequences that meet the criteria for good solutions. Let's build on these insights to propose five new sequences:\n\n1. AAABABABAAAABABABBAB:\nRationale: This sequence is based on the best-performing sequence from this batch (AAABABABAAAABABABBBA) but swaps the final 'A' for a 'B'. This subtle change might further refine the end behavior of the string-like aggregates while maintaining the overall successful structure.\n\n2. AAABABABAAAAABABABBA:\nRationale: This sequence combines elements from two top-performing sequences (AAABABABAAAAABABABAB and AAABABABAAAABABABBBA). It maintains the successful 'AAABABA' start and 'BABBA' end, which have been present in several good solutions.\n\n3. AAABABABAAAABABABABB:\nRationale: Building on the success of sequences with 'AAABABA' start and alternating 'AB' patterns in the latter half, this sequence explores a slight variation in the end pattern. This might create a different balance of attractive and repulsive interactions at the chain end.\n\n4. AABABABAAAAAABABBBBA:\nRationale: This sequence incorporates the successful 'AABABABA' start from previous good solutions with the 'BBBA' end that has also shown promise. The middle section maintains a longer stretch of 'A's, which seems to be beneficial for string-like structures.\n\n5. AAABABABAABAAABABABB:\nRationale: This sequence maintains the successful 'AAABABA' start but introduces a new pattern in the middle with an earlier 'B' insertion. This might create interesting local structures that promote string-like aggregation while still building on our successful patterns.\n\nThese proposals aim to refine our approach based on previous results and explore new possibilities:\n\n1. We're consistently maintaining the 'AAABABA' or 'AABABABA' start, as these have been present in all our best-performing sequences.\n2.
