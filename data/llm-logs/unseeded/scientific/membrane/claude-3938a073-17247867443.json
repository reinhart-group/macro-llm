This combination might enhance sheet formation while providing a flexible edge structure.\n\n5. AAABAAABBAAAAABABAAB:\nRationale: This sequence incorporates elements from several successful previous sequences. It starts with 'AAABAAABB', which has shown promise, followed by a longer 'A' stretch and ending with 'ABAAB'. This might balance sheet formation, stability, and edge properties.\n\nThese proposals aim to refine the most successful patterns we've observed while still exploring subtle variations. They consider the principles of polymer self-assembly by:\n\n1. Maintaining the overall balance of attractive ('A') and repulsive ('B') interactions that has proven effective for sheet-like structures.\n2. Fine-tuning the distribution of 'B' monomers, especially at the ends of the sequences, to optimize edge properties.\n3. Adjusting the length and position of 'A' stretches to potentially influence the extent and quality of sheet formation.\n4. Exploring subtle changes in end sequences to optimize overall morphology and edge properties.\n\nBy making these targeted adjustments based on our most successful sequences so far, we aim to finally reduce the distance below the 1.34 threshold. These refined sequences build upon our best results while still introducing some controlled variations, which may help us achieve the desired sheet-like membrane structure. We're at a critical point in the optimization process, and these subtle tweaks could make the difference in reaching our goal."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired morphology:\nAABAAABBAAAAABABAABA: 3.485\nAABAAABBAAAAAABBAABA: 2.231\nAABAAABBAAAAABABAAAB: 1.811\nAABAAABBAAAAAAABABAB: 5.770\nAAABAAABBAAAAABABAAB: 2.128\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.

While we haven't yet reached our target of 1.34, we're still seeing some promising sequences, particularly AABAAABBAAAAABABAAAB with a distance of 1.811. Let's use these insights to propose five new sequences that might finally get us below the threshold.\n\n1. AABAAABBAAAAABABABAA:\nRationale: This sequence is based on our best performer (AABAAABBAAAAABABAAAB), with a slight modification at the end (moving the last 'B' to the second-to-last position). This adjustment might fine-tune the edge properties of the sheet while maintaining the overall successful pattern.\n\n2. AABAAABBAAAAABAABABA:\nRationale: Building on the success of the 'AABAAABB' start and long 'A' stretch, this sequence introduces a new pattern at the end. The 'BAABABA' ending might provide a better balance between sheet stability and edge flexibility.\n\n3. AAABAAABBAAAAABBAABA:\nRationale: This sequence combines elements from several successful previous sequences. It starts with 'AAABAAABB', which has shown promise, followed by a longer 'A' stretch and ending with 'BAABA'. This might optimize the balance between sheet formation and edge properties.\n\n4. AABAAABBAAAABABAAABA:\nRationale: This proposal maintains the successful 'AABAAABB' start but introduces more frequent 'B' interruptions in the latter half. This might provide a more even distribution of 'B' monomers while still maintaining effective sheet-forming properties.\n\n5. AABAAABBAAAAABABAABA:\nRationale: This sequence is very similar to our best performer but swaps the positions of the last 'A' and 'B'. This subtle change might improve edge interactions while preserving the overall effective structure.\n\nThese proposals aim to refine the most successful patterns we've observed while still exploring subtle variations.
