AAABAAABBBAAABAAABBB: \nReasoning: This sequence alternates groups of attractive 'A' monomers with repulsive 'B' monomers, which might promote sheet-like structures. The 'A' groups could form attractive interactions within the sheet, while the 'B' groups could help prevent stacking of multiple sheets.\n\n2. AAAAABBBBAAAAAABBBB:\nReasoning: This sequence separates the attractive and repulsive monomers into larger blocks. This arrangement might allow for the formation of a sheet-like structure with distinct hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions, similar to a lipid bilayer.\n\n3.

AABAAABBBAAAABABBAAB:\nRationale: This sequence combines elements from our two best performers in this batch. It keeps the successful 'AABAAABBB' start and 'BAAB' end, but adjusts the middle section. This might provide a good balance between sheet formation and edge properties.\n\n3. AABAAABBBAABAABAABBA:\nRationale: Based on our best performer, this sequence introduces more alternation between 'A' and 'B' in the latter half. This could potentially create a more complex edge structure in the sheet-like membrane while keeping the core that has worked well.\n\n4. AABAABBBAAAAABAABBAB:\nRationale: This sequence moves the 'BBB' block earlier and groups more 'A' monomers in the middle, similar to our best performer. This arrangement might affect the curvature or flexibility of the resulting sheet-like structure.\n\n5. AABAAABBBAAAABBAABBA:\nRationale: This sequence is a variation on our best performer, introducing a 'BB' pair in the latter half. This might create a slight kink or curve in the sheet structure, which could be beneficial for certain membrane morphologies.\n\nThese proposals continue to exploit the successful elements of our previous best-performing sequences while also exploring nearby regions of the solution space. They all maintain the required 12:8 ratio of 'A' to 'B' monomers and avoid duplicating previously evaluated sequences.\n\nThe sequences are designed with polymer self-assembly principles in mind, considering how the arrangement of attractive ('A') and repulsive ('B') monomers affects the formation and properties of sheet-like membranes. We're focusing on:\n\n1. The importance of the 'AABAAABBB' start, which appears in our best-performing sequences and likely plays a crucial role in nucleating the sheet structure.\n2. The grouping of 'A' monomers in the middle, which might promote sheet expansion.\n3. The arrangement of 'A' and 'B' monomers in the latter half of the sequence, which likely influences edge properties and overall sheet stability.\n4. The ending sequence, which seems to play a crucial role in determining the final distance to the desired morphology.\n\nBy making these variations, we're aiming to further optimize the sheet-like properties while still maintaining some level of exploration. This approach should help us refine our solutions for sheet-like membrane formation as we near the end of our optimization process, potentially finding sequences that perform even better than our current best."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired morphology:\nAABAAABBBAABAABAABBA: 6.615\nAABAABBBAAAAABAABBAB: 4.146\nAABAAABBBAAAABABBBAB: 1.371\nAABAAABBBAAAABABBBBA: 0.382\nAABBAABBBAAAABABBAAB: 3.383\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.

We've made excellent progress with AABAAABBBAAAABABBBBA achieving a distance of 0.382, which is our best result so far. Let's use this insight to propose five new sequences:\n\n1. AABAAABBBAAAABABBABA:\nRationale: This sequence is very similar to our best performer but swaps the positions of two 'B' monomers near the end. This subtle change might fine-tune the edge properties of the sheet-like structure while maintaining the overall successful pattern.\n\n2. AABAAABBBAAAABABBBAA:\nRationale: Another variation on our best performer, this sequence moves the final 'A' to the end. This might create a slightly different edge property that could further enhance sheet formation or stability.\n\n3. AABAAABBBAAAAABBBBAA:\nRationale: This sequence keeps the successful 'AABAAABBB' start but groups more 'A' monomers together in the middle, followed by a 'BBBB' block. This arrangement might promote more extensive sheet formation in the central region while maintaining good edge properties.\n\n4. AABAABBBAAAABABBBABA:\nRationale: This sequence moves the 'BBB' block earlier, similar to some previously successful sequences, while maintaining the latter half of our best performer. This might affect the curvature or flexibility of the resulting sheet-like structure.\n\n5. AABAAABBBAAABABBBABA:\nRationale: This sequence introduces a slight alternation in the middle ('AAAB' instead of 'AAAA') compared to our best performer.
