AABBAAABBAAABBAABBAB:\nRationale: This sequence combines elements from both successful sequences, using the 'AABB' pattern at the end like in the second-best performer. It might provide a good balance between the two successful motifs.\n\n4. AABBAABBBAABBAAABBAA:\nRationale: This sequence introduces a slight variation in the middle, with three 'B's in a row, inspired by the successful AABBBABBAAABBAAABBAA. This might influence the central structure of the sheet while maintaining successful end patterns.\n\n5. AABBAAABBAAABBAABAAB:\nRationale: This sequence is similar to our best performer but with a slight rearrangement of the last four monomers. This modification might provide insights into the importance of the exact positioning of 'A' and 'B' monomers at the end of the sequence.\n\nThese proposals aim to:\n\n1. Exploit the success of the 'AABB', 'AAABB', and 'AABBB' patterns, which have proven effective in promoting sheet-like structures.\n2. Explore small variations in these patterns, particularly at the ends and middle of the sequence, which might fine-tune the assembly process or overall sheet structure.\n3. Maintain the overall balance between attractive ('A') and repulsive ('B') interactions that appears to be crucial for sheet formation.\n4. Include some variations in pattern regularity to explore nearby solution space and potentially find even better configurations.\n\nThese sequences apply principles of polymer self-assembly by:\n\n1. Utilizing regular patterns that promote ordered structures.\n2. Balancing attractive and repulsive interactions to encourage sheet formation rather than collapse into globules or dispersion into individual polymers.\n3. Considering the potential importance of sequence ends and middle sections in determining overall morphology and edge properties.\n4. Exploring the impact of slight variations in successful patterns on the self-assembly process.\n\nWe're continuing to refine our understanding of what makes a successful sheet-forming sequence while still exploring nearby possibilities in the sequence space. The goal is to potentially find an even better solution or understand the robustness of the current best sequences to small perturbations."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired morphology:\nAABBBABBAAABBAAABBAB: 2.375\nAABBAABBBAABBAAABBAA: 6.302\nAABBAAABBAAABBAABAAB: 1.664\nAABBAAABBAAABBABBBAB: 2.307\nAAABBABBAAABBAAABBAB: 4.697\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.

While we didn't find any new solutions below the 1.34 threshold in this batch, we can still use these insights to propose new sequences. Let's focus on refining our approach based on the patterns we've seen succeed previously. Here are five new proposals:\n\n1. AABBAAABBAAABBAAABBB:\nRationale: This sequence is very similar to our previously best performer (AABBAAABBAAABBAAABAB), but with the last 'A' changed to 'B'. This slight modification might improve edge behavior while maintaining the overall successful structure.\n\n2. AABBAAABBAAABBAAABAA:\nRationale: Another variation on our best performer, this time changing the last 'B' to 'A'. This explores the importance of the terminal monomer in sheet formation.\n\n3. AABBAABBAAABBAAABBAA:\nRationale: This sequence combines elements from successful patterns we've seen, using alternating 'AABB' and 'AAABB' motifs. It might provide a good balance between attractive and repulsive interactions throughout the sequence.\n\n4. AAABBAAABBAAABBAAABB:\nRationale: This sequence uses the 'AAABB' repeating pattern consistently throughout. It explores whether a more regular pattern might lead to better sheet formation.\n\n5. AABBAAABBAAABBAABBBA:\nRationale: This sequence is similar to successful patterns but introduces a slight variation at the end with 'BBBA'. This might provide insights into how small changes in the terminal sequence affect overall morphology.\n\nThese proposals aim to:\n\n1.
