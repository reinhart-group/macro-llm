We've found an even better solution with AABBAAABBAAABBAAABBB, which has a distance of 0.448. This is a significant improvement and well within our target of less than 1.34. Let's use this insight to propose five new sequences:\n\n1. AABBAAABBAAABBAAABBA:\nRationale: This sequence is nearly identical to our best performer, with only the last monomer changed from 'B' to 'A'. This minor modification might fine-tune the edge properties of the sheet while maintaining the overall successful structure.\n\n2. AABBAAABBAAABBAAABBAB:\nRationale: Building on our best sequence, this proposal adds one more monomer (B) at the end. This might provide insight into how a slight length increase affects sheet formation and stability.\n\n3. AABBAABBAAABBAAABBB:\nRationale: This sequence maintains the successful end of our best performer but modifies the middle section slightly. The 'AABBAA' pattern in the middle might create a different periodicity in the sheet structure while keeping the effective end segments.\n\n4. AAABBAAABBAAABBAAABBB:\nRationale: This sequence starts with 'AAA' instead of 'AABB', potentially creating a different initiation point for the sheet formation. It then follows our best-performing sequence exactly, which might lead to interesting sheet properties with a modified start.\n\n5.
