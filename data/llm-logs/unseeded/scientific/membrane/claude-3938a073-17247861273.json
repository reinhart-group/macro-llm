AAABBAABAAAABAABBAAB:\nRationale: This sequence combines elements from our previous successful solutions. It maintains the 'AAABB' start, which has been consistently effective, and ends with 'BAAB', which was present in some of our better-performing sequences.\n\n3. AAABBAABAAAABBABAABB:\nRationale: This sequence keeps the successful 'AAABB' start and 'AABB' end but introduces a new 'BBA' motif in the middle. This might create a slight kink or bend in the sheet structure, potentially optimizing its overall morphology.\n\n4. AAABBAABAABAAABBAABB:\nRationale: This proposal maintains the 'AAABB' start and 'AABB' end but redistributes the 'B' monomers in the middle section. The alternating 'AB' pattern in the middle might provide a different growth dynamic for the sheet.\n\n5. AAABBAABAAAABAAABBAB:\nRationale: This sequence is a variation on our previous successful patterns, with a slight modification at the end. The 'ABBAB' end might provide a different edge structure to the forming sheet, potentially improving its properties.\n\nThese proposals aim to refine our understanding of the sequence-structure relationship while trying to recapture and improve upon our previous successes. They focus on:\n\n1. Maintaining the successful 'AAABB' start, which appears crucial for nucleating sheet-like structures.\n2. Exploring variations in the middle and end sections of the sequence, which might fine-tune sheet properties and edge structures.\n3. Balancing longer 'A' stretches for sheet formation with strategic 'B' placements for structural stability.\n4. Introducing subtle variations that might reveal more about the system's sensitivity to specific monomer arrangements.\n\nThese strategies continue to be grounded in polymer self-assembly principles. We're recognizing that the 'AAABB' start is critical, possibly serving as a nucleation point for sheet formation. The variations in the middle and end sequences aim to optimize the growth, stability, and edge properties of the sheets.\n\nGiven that we've moved away from our previous best solutions, these proposals serve to:\n1. Reconfirm the performance of our previously successful sequences.\n2. Explore nearby sequence space to potentially uncover new, optimal arrangements.\n3. Understand the robustness and reproducibility of our solutions.\n\nThis approach balances exploitation of our previously successful patterns with continued exploration, which is crucial for thoroughly investigating the sequence space and finding the most optimal solutions."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired morphology:\nAAABBAABAAAABBABAABB: 4.262\nAAABBAABAABAAABBAABB: 2.792\nAAABBAABAAAABAAABBAB: 1.163\nAAABBAABAAAAAAABAABB: 6.953\nABABBAABAAAABAABBAAB: 3.464\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
