This might provide an even stronger initiation point for sheet formation while preserving the overall successful structure.\n\n3. AABAAABBBAAAAABBBAAA:\nRationale: This sequence maintains the successful start of 'AABAAABBB' but increases the central 'A' cluster to five. This might promote stronger attractive interactions in the middle of the sheet while maintaining the overall balance that has proven effective.\n\n4. AABAAABBBAAAABBBAABB:\nRationale: This sequence is identical to our best performer except for the last two monomers, which are switched to 'BB'. This change might affect the termination of the sheet structure and could potentially lead to interesting morphological changes.\n\n5. BAABAAABBBAAAABBBAAA:\nRationale: This sequence explores starting with a 'B' monomer while maintaining the overall successful pattern. This change in the initiation point might lead to a different sheet formation process that could be favorable.\n\nThese sequences continue to exploit the successful patterns we've observed, particularly:\n1. The importance of 'BBB' clusters, likely crucial for creating separation between sheet layers.\n2. The presence of a larger 'A' cluster (3-5 consecutive 'A's) in the middle, which seems to promote favorable sheet-like structures.\n3. The 'AABAAABBB' motif at the start of the sequence, which has proven successful in our latest result.\n\nPrinciples from polymer self-assembly applied:\n1. Balancing attractive and repulsive interactions to promote sheet formation.\n2. Exploring the impact of sequence asymmetry on overall morphology.\n3. Investigating how slight variations in monomer distribution can fine-tune the self-assembly process.\n4. Considering the potential role of terminal groups in initiating or stabilizing sheet-like structures.\n5. Examining the effect of changing the initiation point of the sequence on the overall self-assembly process.\n\nThese proposals represent a focused exploration around our most successful result, aiming to further optimize the self-assembly process for sheet-like membrane formation.

We've found two new sequences that meet our criteria for good solutions, with AABAAABBBAAAABBBAAAB performing exceptionally well with a distance of 0.273. Let's build upon these successes:\n\n1. AABAAABBBAAAABBBAABA:\nRationale: This sequence is very similar to our best performer but with the last 'B' moved to the second-to-last position. This slight modification might further optimize the sheet-like structure by altering the terminal interactions while maintaining the successful overall pattern.\n\n2.
