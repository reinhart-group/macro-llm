It maintains the successful 'AABAAABBB' start, followed by a group of 'A's, and ends with a 'BBBB' block and two 'A's. This arrangement might offer a good balance for sheet formation.\n\n4. AABAAABBBAAAABBBABBA:\nRationale: Another variation on our best sequence, this one rearranges the last five monomers. The 'ABBA' end might influence how the sheets interact with each other or terminate.\n\n5. AABAABBBAAAABBBBABAA:\nRationale: This sequence explores moving one 'B' earlier to create a 'BBB' block, while maintaining the successful 'BBBB' block near the end. This might affect the distribution of hydrophobic regions within the membrane.\n\nThese sequences all maintain the required 12:8 ratio of 'A' to 'B' monomers and are designed based on the principles of polymer self-assembly for sheet-like membranes.\n\nKey design principles:\n\n1. The 'AABAAABBB' motif at the start is maintained in most sequences, as it seems crucial for good performance. This pattern likely helps initiate and stabilize sheet formation.\n\n2. The 'BBBB' block near the end, present in our best performer, is preserved or slightly modified in most proposals. This might be important for creating a strong hydrophobic region that influences sheet properties.\n\n3. The distribution of 'A' and 'B' monomers in the middle and end of the sequences is varied slightly to explore how it affects sheet formation and stability.\n\nThese proposals balance exploitation of our excellent solution (0.575) with careful exploration of nearby sequence space. At this stage, we're making very subtle changes to try to further optimize the self-assembly behavior towards the desired sheet-like membrane morphology.\n\nThe goal is to find the optimal balance that promotes sheet-like membrane formation while minimizing unwanted aggregation or alternative structures. By exploring these slight variations, we hope to either improve upon our best result or confirm its optimality."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired morphology:\nAABAAABBBAAAABBBBAAA: 0.462\nAABAAABBBAAAAABBBBAA: 0.251\nAABAAABBBAAAABBBABBA: 0.735\nAABAABBBAAAABBBBABAA: 1.308\nAAAAAABBBAAAABBBBABA: 10.450\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.

We've achieved multiple sequences with distances below 1.34, with AABAAABBBAAAAABBBBAA performing exceptionally well at 0.251. Let's use these insights to propose five new sequences that might further optimize or explore nearby solution space:\n\n1. AABAAABBBAAAAABBBBAA:\nRationale: This is our best performer so far. We're including it again to confirm its excellent performance and use it as a baseline for comparison.\n\n2. AABAAABBBAAAABBBBAAA:\nRationale: This sequence performed very well (0.462) and is worth retesting to confirm its performance.
