We're making steady progress, with AAABAAABABAABBBABBAA achieving our best distance yet at 5.119. We'll continue to refine this pattern while exploring some variations. Here are five new proposals:\n\n1. AAABAAABABAABBBBABAA:\nRationale: This sequence is very similar to our best performer but groups four 'B' monomers together near the end. This might create a more defined edge structure while maintaining the overall successful pattern.\n\n2. AAABAAABABABBBABBAA:\nRationale: Building on the success of our best performer, this sequence slightly adjusts the distribution of 'B' monomers in the middle. This might influence the curvature or folding of the sheet structure.\n\n3. AAABAAABABAABBBBAABA:\nRationale: This proposal maintains the successful start of our best sequence but adjusts the end pattern. This could potentially create a different edge structure that might improve overall sheet formation.\n\n4. AAABAAABBAABBBBABBAA:\nRationale: This sequence introduces a pair of 'B' monomers earlier in the chain while maintaining a similar end pattern to our best performer. This might affect the initial sheet nucleation while preserving the successful edge formation.\n\n5.
