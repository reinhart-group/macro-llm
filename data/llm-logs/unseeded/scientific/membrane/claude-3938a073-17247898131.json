I've moved one 'A' bead to the beginning and one 'B' bead to the end. This might help create a more stable sheet-like structure by promoting attractive interactions at one end and repulsive interactions at the other.\n\n2. AAAABAABBAABBAAABBBA:\nReasoning: This sequence features longer continuous stretches of 'A' beads, which might promote stronger attractive interactions and sheet formation. The 'B' beads are more evenly distributed, which could help prevent excessive aggregation and maintain a membrane-like structure.\n\n3. ABAAABAAABBAABAAABBB:\nReasoning: This sequence alternates between short stretches of 'A' and 'B' beads, which might promote a balance between attraction and repulsion necessary for sheet-like membranes. The concentration of 'B' beads at the end could help prevent excessive stacking of sheets.\n\n4. AAAABBAAABBAABAAABBA:\nReasoning: This sequence features a mix of longer 'A' stretches and shorter 'B' stretches. The alternating pattern in the middle might promote sheet formation, while the 'A' beads at the ends could help connect multiple sheets into larger membrane-like structures.\n\n5.

AABAAABBAAAAABABBABB:\nRationale: We're maintaining the highly successful core of the best-performing sequence but adjusting the very end. This arrangement might optimize the balance between attractive and repulsive interactions at the edge of the sheet structure.\n\n3. AABAAABBAAAABABBABAA:\nRationale: This sequence introduces the 'B' beads slightly earlier in the latter half of the sequence. This could potentially create a more complex internal structure in the sheet while preserving the edge properties that have proven successful.\n\n4. AABAABBAAAAABABBABAA:\nRationale: We're exploring the effect of moving one 'B' bead earlier in the sequence while maintaining the successful latter half. This might influence the sheet formation process from the start while keeping the overall pattern that has shown great promise.\n\n5. AABAAABBAAAAABABAABB:\nRationale: This sequence keeps the successful core but explores a different arrangement of 'B' beads at the very end. This could potentially create unique edge structures that might further stabilize the sheet morphology.\n\nThese proposals aim to refine our approach based on the patterns we've seen in our most successful sequences while also exploring nearby variations. We're focusing on:\n\n1. Maintaining the highly successful \"AABAAABBAAAAABAB\" core, which appears to be crucial for good performance.\n2. Fine-tuning the distribution of 'B' beads, especially towards the end of the sequence, to optimize edge definition and overall sheet morphology.\n3. Exploring slight variations in the arrangement of 'B' beads to potentially uncover even better configurations.\n4. Balancing the long stretch of attractive 'A' beads in the middle with strategic placement of repulsive 'B' beads to promote sheet formation while preventing excessive aggregation.\n\nAs we continue through the iterations, we're now focusing more on exploitation of the successful patterns we've discovered, while still allowing for some exploration in nearby solution space. We're aiming to find the optimal arrangement that yields the most stable and well-defined sheet-like membrane morphologies.
