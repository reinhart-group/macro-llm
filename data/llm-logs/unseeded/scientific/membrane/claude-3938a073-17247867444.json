AABAAABBAAAABBAABBBA:\nRationale: This sequence combines elements from the best solution (0.730) and previously successful sequences. It starts with 'AABAAABB' (which has been successful before) and ends with 'AAAABBAABBBA' from the 0.730 sequence. This combination might optimize sheet formation and stability.\n\n3. AABAABBAAAABBAAABBBA:\nRationale: This sequence keeps the successful 'AABAABB' start and 'AAAABBAA' middle from the best-performing sequence but modifies the end. The 'ABBBA' ending might create a different edge structure that could enhance membrane-like properties.\n\n4. AABBAABBAAAABBAABBAA:\nRationale: This sequence explores a variation with a longer continuous 'A' segment at the start. It incorporates successful motifs from the good solution while introducing a new 'AABB' pattern at the beginning. This might promote sheet formation with controlled thickness or flexibility.\n\n5. AABAABBAAAABAAABBBAA:\nRationale: This sequence maintains elements of the successful patterns but rearranges the 'B' monomers in the middle. The 'AABAABB' start and 'BBBAA' ending are kept from the best sequence, with a modified middle section. This might create a unique internal structure that could be beneficial for sheet-like membranes.\n\nThese proposals aim to refine the successful patterns observed in the previous batches, particularly focusing on variations of the excellent solution (0.730) and incorporating elements from previously successful sequences. They introduce controlled variations to explore nearby sequence space while maintaining the overall characteristics that led to good performance.\n\nThe sequences maintain a balance between attractive 'A' monomers to promote sheet formation and repulsive 'B' monomers to prevent overly compact structures. The variations introduced (such as redistributing 'B' monomers, combining successful motifs, or introducing new patterns) are designed to potentially enhance the self-assembly of sheet-like membranes by influencing factors like edge structure, sheet thickness, and overall morphology.\n\nThese designs take into account the principles of polymer self-assembly in the context of the Kremer-Grest model, aiming to create sequences that will promote the formation of sheet-like membranes through a balance of attractive and repulsive interactions. The goal is to maintain or improve upon the performance of the best sequence (0.730) while also exploring new possibilities that could lead to even better solutions."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired morphology:\nAABAABBAAAABBAABBBAB: 2.354\nAABAABBAAAABBAAABBBA: 1.596\nAABBAABBAAAABBAABBAA: 2.438\nAABAABBAAAABAAABBBAA: 2.394\nAABAAABBAAAABBAAAABA: 4.792\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.

AABAABBAAAABBAABBAAA:\nRationale: This sequence is based on the previously best-performing sequence (0.730) but modifies the ending. We've replaced the final 'BBAA' with 'BAAA', which might create a different edge structure that could enhance membrane-like properties while maintaining the successful core pattern.\n\n2.
