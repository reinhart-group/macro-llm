We've found another good solution with AAABAABBBAAABAAAABBB (distance 1.082), which is very close to our previous best. Let's use these insights to propose five new sequences that might yield even better results.\n\n1. AAABAABBBAAABAAAABBA:\nRationale: This sequence is identical to our previous best performer (0.907 distance). Given that very similar sequences have performed well, it's worth re-evaluating this exact sequence to confirm its performance and stability.\n\n2. AAABAABBBAAABAAABAAB:\nRationale: We've maintained the successful 'AAABAABBBAAABAAAA' core but slightly modified the ending. This explores whether a different arrangement of the final 'A' and 'B' beads might further improve sheet edge structure.\n\n3. AAABAABBBAABAAAAAABB:\nRationale: This sequence keeps the successful start and end but introduces a variation in the middle. It investigates whether a different arrangement of 'A's and 'B's in the central region might affect sheet properties while keeping the beneficial terminal structures.\n\n4. AAAABAABBBAAABAAAABA:\nRationale: We've added one more 'A' to the beginning and adjusted the end compared to our best performers. This explores whether a longer initial 'A' stretch might enhance sheet nucleation while maintaining a similar overall pattern.\n\n5. AAABAAABBBAAABAAAAAB:\nRationale: This sequence combines elements from our previous successful patterns. It starts with the 'AAABAAABBB' motif that has shown promise before, but ends with a longer stretch of 'A's followed by a single 'B', which might affect sheet termination.\n\nThese sequences are designed to exploit the success of the AAABAABBBAAABAAAABBA and AAABAABBBAAABAAAABBB patterns while still exploring nearby sequence space.
