I've moved one 'A' bead to the beginning and one 'B' bead to the end. This might help create a more stable sheet-like structure by promoting attractive interactions at one end and repulsive interactions at the other.\n\n2. AAAABAABBAABBAAABBBA:\nReasoning: This sequence features alternating groups of 'A' and 'B' beads, which could promote the formation of sheet-like structures. The longer stretches of 'A' beads at the beginning and end might help initiate and stabilize the membrane formation.\n\n3. ABAAABAAABBAABAAABBB:\nReasoning: This sequence has a gradual increase in the frequency of 'B' beads towards the end.

This arrangement might promote the formation of a bilayer-like structure, which could lead to sheet-like membranes.\n\n5. BAABAAABAAABBAAABBAA:\nReasoning: This sequence explores a different arrangement with 'B' beads more evenly distributed throughout the chain.

BAABAABBAAAABBAAABBA:\nRationale: This sequence maintains the successful \"BAABAABB\" start from our best performer but changes the arrangement of 'B' beads in the latter half. This might create a different pattern of hydrophobic regions that could still promote sheet-like structures.\n\n3. AABAABBAAAAAABBBAABA:\nRationale: This sequence is based on our second-best performer (AABAABBAAAAAABBAAABA) but incorporates the \"AAABBB\" motif that has been successful in other sequences. This combination might yield an even better sheet-like structure.\n\n4. BAABAABAAAAABBBAABAA:\nRationale: This sequence was successful in a previous iteration (distance 1.157). It's worth revisiting as it shares some similarities with our current best performers and might still yield good results.\n\n5. BAABAABBAAAAABBAAABA:\nRationale: This sequence combines elements from both of our good performers. It starts with \"BAABAABB\" from the best sequence and ends with \"AABBAAABA\" from the second-best. This combination might leverage the strengths of both sequences.\n\nThese proposals continue to balance exploitation of our successful sequences with further exploration. We're maintaining elements that seem to work well while introducing variations that might further improve sheet-like membrane formation.\n\nKey principles of polymer self-assembly considered in these sequences:\n\n1. The \"BAABAABB\" or \"AABAABB\" motif at the start seems to be particularly effective, possibly creating a stable core for the sheet-like structure.\n2. The \"AAAABBB\" or \"AAAAAABB\" stretch in the middle likely forms a strong hydrophobic region that promotes sheet formation.\n3. The arrangement of 'B' beads towards the ends may help define the edges of the sheet and prevent collapse into more globular forms.\n4. Starting the sequence with a 'B' bead appears to be beneficial, possibly by influencing the initial folding process.\n5. The overall balance and distribution of 'A' and 'B' beads promote the formation of extended structures rather than compact globules.\n\nWe're focusing on subtle variations of the most successful patterns, as small changes can sometimes lead to significant improvements. At the same time, we're introducing some combinations of successful elements from different sequences to explore new possibilities while maintaining the overall characteristics that have proven successful."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired morphology:\nBAABAABBAAAABBBAAABA: 2.524\nBAABAABBAAAABBAAABBA: 3.670\nAABAABBAAAAAABBBAABA: 2.652\nBAABAABBAAAAABBAAABA: 2.394\nBAABAABBABAABBBAABAA: 12.789\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.

It's interesting to note that none of the sequences in this batch achieved a distance less than 1.34. Let's use this information to refine our approach and propose new sequences that might yield better results.\n\n1. BAABAABBAAAABBBAABAA:\nRationale: This was our previous best performer (distance 0.542) and wasn't included in the last batch. Given that none of the recent variations improved upon it, it's crucial to propose it again to confirm its performance.\n\n2.
