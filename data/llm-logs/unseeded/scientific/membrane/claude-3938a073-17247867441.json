I've moved one 'A' bead to the beginning and one 'B' bead to the end. This might help create a more stable sheet-like structure by promoting attractive interactions at one end and repulsive interactions at the other.\n\n2. AAAABAABBAABBAAABBBA:\nReasoning: This sequence features longer continuous stretches of 'A' beads, which might promote stronger attractive interactions and sheet formation. The 'B' beads are more evenly distributed, which could help prevent excessive aggregation and maintain a membrane-like structure.\n\n3. ABAAABAAABBAABAAABBB:\nReasoning: This sequence alternates between short stretches of 'A' and 'B' beads, which might promote a balance between attraction and repulsion necessary for sheet-like membranes.

AAAABBAAABBAABAAABBA:\nReasoning: This sequence features a mix of longer 'A' stretches and shorter 'B' stretches. The alternating pattern in the middle might promote sheet formation, while the 'A' beads at the ends could help connect multiple sheets into larger membrane-like structures.\n\n5.

While we haven't improved upon our previous best performer (BBBAABBAAAABABBAAABA: 1.101), we've gained new insights. Let's use this information to guide our next proposals, balancing exploitation of successful patterns with continued exploration.\n\n1. BBBAAABAAAABABBAABBA:\nRationale: This sequence combines elements from the best performer in the last batch (BBBAAABAAAABABBAAABA) with a slight modification at the end. The \"AABBA\" ending might improve sheet edge formation while maintaining the successful core structure.\n\n2. BBBAABAAAABABBAAABA:\nRationale: We're modifying our overall best performer by removing one 'B' from the initial cluster. This might create a slightly different balance of hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions at the start, potentially improving sheet formation.\n\n3. BBBAAABAAABBABBAAABA:\nRationale: This sequence keeps the successful \"BBBAAABAA\" start but introduces a new pattern in the middle. The \"ABBABBA\" section might create a more defined hydrophobic core, potentially enhancing sheet-like structure formation.\n\n4. ABBAABAAAABABBAAABA:\nRationale: We're exploring a variation that starts with \"ABB\" instead of \"BBB\", inspired by one of the better performers from the last batch. This change in the initial hydrophobic region might influence the overall sheet formation process.\n\n5. BBBAABAAAAABABBABABA:\nRationale: This sequence builds on the \"BBBAABAAAAABABB\" pattern that has shown promise, but modifies the end to \"ABABA\". This alternating pattern at the end might promote better sheet edge formation while maintaining the overall successful structure.\n\nThese sequences aim to exploit the success of our best-performing patterns while still exploring new possibilities.
