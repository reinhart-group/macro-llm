It keeps the start from the second-best performer and the end from the best performer, which might yield an even better result.\n\n3. AABAABAABAAABBAABABA:\nRationale: Another variation on our best performer, this sequence adjusts the last four monomers. The 'BABA' end might affect the vesicle's curvature or stability while keeping the successful core intact.\n\n4. AABAABAABAABBBAAABBA:\nRationale: This sequence maintains the successful 'AABAA' start and 'AABBA' end from our best performer but introduces variation in the middle. This explores how a different distribution of 'B' monomers in the center affects vesicle formation.\n\n5. AABAABAABAAABBABABAA:\nRationale: This sequence keeps the successful first half of our best performer but introduces more 'B' monomers towards the end. This might help us understand the importance of the 'B' distribution in achieving the desired morphology.\n\nThese proposals are designed based on the following principles and considerations:\n\n1. Exploitation: We're heavily leveraging the patterns from the two sequences that achieved distances below 1.34, making small modifications to potentially find even better solutions.\n\n2. Limited Exploration: While focusing on successful patterns, we're still introducing some variations to explore the nearby solution space and avoid getting stuck in a local minimum.\n\n3. Polymer Self-Assembly Principles:\n   - We maintain a balance of attractive ('A') and repulsive ('B') interactions that have proven successful in forming hollow vesicles.\n   - The sequences retain the overall structure that likely promotes appropriate curvature for vesicle formation.\n   - We're exploring how small changes in monomer distribution, especially in the middle and at the ends of the chain, might affect vesicle closure and stability.\n\n4. Avoiding Duplicates: All proposed sequences are new and haven't been evaluated in previous iterations.\n\n5. Strategic Modifications: Changes are made strategically, either at the ends of the chain or in the middle section, to understand which parts of the sequence are most critical for achieving the desired morphology.\n\nIn the next iterations, depending on the results from these sequences, we may further refine our approach, potentially focusing even more on exploiting the most successful patterns if they continue to yield good results (distances < 1.34). We're getting very close to consistently achieving the desired morphology, so fine-tuning these successful patterns is crucial."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired morphology:\nAABAABAABAAABBAAABAA: 1.874\nAABAABAABAAABBAABABA: 3.654\nAABAABAABAABBBAAABBA: 4.324\nAABAABAABAAABBABABAA: 1.358\nAABAABBBABAAABBAAABA: 0.912\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.

We've found another good solution with a distance of 0.912, which is well below the 1.34 threshold. Let's build on this success while still maintaining some exploration. Here are five new proposed sequences:\n\n1. AABAABBBABAAABBAAABB:\nRationale: This sequence is nearly identical to our best performer (0.912), with only the last 'A' changed to 'B'. This minor modification might fine-tune the vesicle closure while maintaining the overall successful structure.\n\n2.
