While we haven't reached our target of <1.34, we have a promising result with 1.645. Let's build on this and our previous successful sequences to propose new candidates.\n\n1. AABAABAABAAAABBAABAA:\nRationale: This is our previously best-performing sequence (0.549). Given its consistent success, it's worth re-evaluating to ensure it wasn't missed in recent iterations and to use as a baseline.\n\n2. ABBAABAABAAAABAABAA:\nRationale: This sequence is inspired by our current best (1.645) but moves the 'BB' pair earlier and extends the 'AAAA' stretch. This might fine-tune the balance between hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions.\n\n3. AABAABAABAAAABBAABA:\nRationale: This sequence is very similar to our previous best performer but removes the final 'A'. This slight change might affect the closure of the vesicle and potentially improve its stability.\n\n4. ABBAABAABAAAABAABAB:\nRationale: Building on the success of the 'ABB' start in our current best, this sequence redistributes some 'B' monomers to create a more balanced hydrophobic distribution along the chain.\n\n5. AABAABAABAAAABBABAA:\nRationale: This sequence maintains most of the successful pattern from our best performers but introduces a single 'B' near the end. This might create a small hydrophobic patch that could influence vesicle closure.\n\nThese proposals aim to refine our most successful patterns while introducing subtle variations to explore nearby solution spaces. We're maintaining key elements that have proven successful, particularly the 'AABAAB' motif and a concentration of 'A' monomers in the middle to latter part of the sequence.\n\nWe're focusing on fine-tuning the distribution of 'A' and 'B' monomers, especially at the beginning and end of the sequences.
