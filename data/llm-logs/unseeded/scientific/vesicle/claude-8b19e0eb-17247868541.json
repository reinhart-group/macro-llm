While we didn't improve on our best result of 1.028, we've gained more insights. Let's use this information to propose five new sequences that might yield better results.\n\n1. AABAAABABAAABBABABAB:\nRationale: This sequence is very similar to our previous best performer (1.028), but we've moved the final 'A' to the end. This slight change might affect the closure of the vesicle while maintaining the highly successful core structure. The alternating 'BABAB' ending could promote a specific curvature for optimal vesicle formation.\n\n2. AABAAABABAAABBBAAABA:\nRationale: This sequence builds on the relatively successful sequence (1.555) from the last batch. We've kept the 'BBB' segment in the latter half but modified the ending to 'AAABA', which has been present in several good performers. This might balance the bend created by the 'BBB' segment with a favorable closing structure.\n\n3. AABAAABABABAABABABAA:\nRationale: While maintaining the successful 'AABAAABA' start, this sequence introduces more alternating 'AB' pairs in the middle and end. This increased alternation throughout the sequence might promote more uniform curvature during the self-assembly process.\n\n4. AABAAABABAABABBABABA:\nRationale: This sequence keeps the successful start and end portions but modifies the middle section. The 'BAABAB' segment in the middle might create a specific bend in the polymer that could be beneficial for vesicle formation, while the 'BABABA' ending has been associated with good performance.\n\n5. AABAABABAAABABBABABA:\nRationale: This sequence combines elements from several successful sequences. It starts with 'AABAA', which has been consistently good, followed by alternating 'AB' pairs, then 'AAABAB' which might create a favorable hydrophobic patch, and ends with 'BABABA' which has been associated with good performance.\n\nThese proposals are based on the following principles and observations:\n\n1. The 'AABAAABA' start continues to appear crucial for success, so we've maintained this or close variations in all sequences.\n2. The overall balance of hydrophobic (A) and hydrophilic (B) monomers is key to self-assembly, so we're making only small adjustments to this balance.\n3. The 'BABABA' or similar alternating endings seem to be beneficial, appearing in several good performers. We're exploring variations of this ending.\n4. The placement of 'B' monomers appears to be critical for achieving the right curvature. We're exploring different distributions of 'B' monomers, especially in the middle and end of the sequences.\n5. We're maintaining an overall structure similar to successful sequences while introducing small variations that might fine-tune the self-assembly process.\n\nThese sequences all maintain the required 12:8 ratio of 'A' to 'B' monomers and avoid exact duplication of previous sequences. They represent a balance between exploiting what we know works well (particularly the successful core structure and endings) and exploring new possibilities that might lead to even better results. The goal is to find more solutions below the 1.34 threshold and potentially improve upon our best result of 1.028."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired morphology:\nAABAAABABAAABBABABAB: 3.813\nAABAAABABAAABBBAAABA: 0.144\nAABAAABABABAABABABAA: 6.456\nAABAAABABAABABBABABA: 4.583\nAABAABABAAABABBABABA: 4.458\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.

We've found an outstanding solution with a distance of 0.144, which is significantly better than our previous best. Let's focus on exploiting this success while still maintaining some exploration.\n\n1. AABAAABABAAABBBAAABB:\nRationale: This sequence is very similar to our best performer (0.144), but we've changed the last 'A' to a 'B'. This slight modification might further fine-tune the vesicle closure while maintaining the highly successful core structure. The 'BBB' segment in the latter half seems to be crucial for the excellent performance.\n\n2. AABAAABABAAABBBAABAA:\nRationale: Another variation on our best performer, this sequence keeps the successful core and the 'BBB' segment but rearranges the last four monomers. This change could affect the final stages of vesicle formation while preserving the key elements that led to success.\n\n3. AABAABABABAABBBAAABA:\nRationale: This sequence maintains the successful 'AABAA' start and 'BBBAAABA' end but introduces more alternating 'AB' pairs in the middle. This might create a different curvature in the early stages of assembly while keeping the crucial latter half intact.\n\n4. AABAAABABABBBAAABABA:\nRationale: Here, we've moved the 'BBB' segment slightly earlier in the sequence while maintaining the successful start and a similar ending. This could change the point at which the sharp bend occurs in the polymer chain, potentially affecting the overall vesicle structure.\n\n5. AABAAABABAAABBBABAAA:\nRationale: This sequence is another close variation of our best performer, with a slight rearrangement of the last five monomers. The 'BAAA' ending might create a strong hydrophobic patch that could influence the final stages of vesicle closure.\n\nThese proposals are based on the following principles and observations:\n\n1. The 'AABAAABA' start continues to be crucial for success, so we've maintained this in all sequences.\n2. The 'BBB' segment in the latter half of the sequence appears to be a key feature of our best performer, so we've included it in all proposals with slight variations in position.\n3. The overall balance of hydrophobic (A) and hydrophilic (B) monomers is key to self-assembly, so we're making only small adjustments to this balance.\n4. The ending of the sequence likely plays a critical role in vesicle closure, so we're exploring different combinations of 'A' and 'B' at the end while keeping elements that have proven successful.\n5.
