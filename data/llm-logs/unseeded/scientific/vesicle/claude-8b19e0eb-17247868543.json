While we haven't reached our target of distances less than 1.34, we see some improvement with the best performer at 4.713. Let's analyze these results and propose new sequences that might lead us closer to our goal.\n\n1. BAABAABAAAABBAABAABA:\nRationale: This sequence is based on our best performer (4.713) with a slight modification at the end. The 'BAABA' ending might create a different curvature that could improve vesicle closure while maintaining the core structure that performed well.\n\n2. ABAABAABAAAAABBAAABB:\nRationale: This sequence starts with 'ABA' instead of 'BAA', includes a longer stretch of 'A' monomers in the middle, and ends with 'AAABB'. This might create a more asymmetric structure that could potentially form a better vesicle shape.\n\n3. BAABAABAABAAAABBAABA:\nRationale: This sequence combines elements from our previous best performer (0.987 from two batches ago) and our current best performer. It might capture the benefits of both sequences to create a more optimal structure.\n\n4. BAABAABAAAABABABAABA:\nRationale: This sequence maintains the successful 'BAABAA' start but introduces more alternating 'AB' pairs in the latter half. This might create a region of higher curvature that could help shape the vesicle.\n\n5. AABAABAABAAAABBAAABB:\nRationale: This sequence starts with 'AA' instead of 'BAA', which might change the initial folding dynamics. It then follows a pattern similar to our best performers but ends with 'AAABB', potentially creating a different closure mechanism.\n\nThese proposals aim to balance the insights from our previous successes with the need to explore new variations. They maintain some principles that have shown promise:\n\n1. Preserving the 'BAABAA' or 'AABAA' motifs that have appeared in better-performing sequences.\n2. Including stretches of 'A' monomers, which might stabilize certain parts of the vesicle structure.\n3. Strategic placement of 'B' monomers to aid in vesicle formation and closure.\n\nIn the context of polymer self-assembly, these sequences are designed to:\n1. Create regions of different curvature along the polymer chain to promote vesicle formation.\n2. Balance attractive ('A') and repulsive ('B') interactions to achieve the desired morphology.\n3.
