AABAABABABAAABAAABBA:\nRationale: This sequence maintains the successful 'AABAA' start and 'ABBA' end, but rearranges the middle section. The alternating 'BABABA' in the middle might provide a more consistent curvature throughout the chain.\n\n4. AABAAABAAABABAAABBAA:\nRationale: This sequence keeps the successful start and end patterns but introduces a longer stretch of 'A' monomers early in the sequence. This might create a stronger attractive core at the beginning, potentially optimizing the overall vesicle shape.\n\n5. AABAABABAAABAAABABBA:\nRationale: This sequence combines elements from our successful sequences but introduces slight variations. The 'BAABA' pattern in the middle might create a unique curvature that could be beneficial for vesicle formation.\n\nThese proposals are designed with the following principles of polymer self-assembly for hollow vesicle formation in mind:\n\n1. Maintaining the overall balance of attractive ('A') and repulsive ('B') interactions that has proven successful in our best-performing sequences.\n2. Exploring small variations in monomer distribution to fine-tune the curvature necessary for optimal vesicle formation.\n3. Keeping successful motifs (like the 'AABAA' start and 'ABBA' or 'ABA' end) that seem to contribute to good performance.\n4. Investigating the effects of different patterns of 'A' and 'B' monomers in the middle of the sequence, which might influence the stability and shape of the vesicle.\n\nThis batch of proposals aims to exploit our recent successes while still allowing for some exploration of the nearby sequence space. We're focusing on understanding which elements of the sequence are crucial for achieving the desired hollow vesicle morphology and which can be modified to potentially improve performance even further. \n\nAs we continue to iterate, we're homing in on sequences that consistently perform well, while also testing small variations that might lead to even better results. The goal is to find the optimal balance of attractive and repulsive interactions that promotes the formation of stable, hollow vesicles in the coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired morphology:\nAABAAABABAAABAAABABA: 1.534\nAABAABABABAAABAAABBA: 1.698\nAABAAABAAABABAAABBAA: 4.629\nAABAABABAAABAAABABBA: 0.294\nAABBAABABAAABAAABBAA: 1.944\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.

We've found a new best solution with AABAABABAAABAAABABBA achieving a distance of 0.294. Let's use this insight along with our previous successful sequences to propose five new sequences that could potentially yield even better results or explore nearby solution space.\n\n1. AABAABABAAABAAABABAA:\nRationale: This sequence is nearly identical to our new best performer (0.294), with only the last 'BA' swapped to 'AA'. This minor change might further optimize the vesicle closure while maintaining the overall successful structure.\n\n2. AABAABAABABAAABABABA:\nRationale: This sequence keeps the successful 'AABAA' start and 'BABABA' end from our best performer but introduces a slight variation in the middle. The 'BAABA' in the middle might create a unique curvature that could be beneficial for vesicle formation.\n\n3. AABAABABAAABABAABABA:\nRationale: Building on the success of our best sequence, this proposal keeps the first 12 monomers identical but modifies the last 8. This explores whether a different ending pattern can further improve vesicle formation.\n\n4. AABAAABABAAABAAABABBA:\nRationale: This sequence combines elements from our previous best performers. It starts with 'AABAAABA', which has been successful, and ends with 'ABABBA' from our new best sequence. This might create an optimal balance for vesicle formation.\n\n5. ABAAABABAAABAAABABBA:\nRationale: This sequence is very similar to our best performer but starts with 'ABA' instead of 'AAB'.
