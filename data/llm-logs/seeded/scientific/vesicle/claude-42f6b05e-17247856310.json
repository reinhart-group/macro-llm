BBABAABAAABBAABAAABA\nRationale: Another variation on our best performer, this time swapping the positions of the last two monomers. This explores whether a different ending can enhance vesicle closure while keeping the successful overall structure.\n\n3. BBABAABAAAABAABAABAA\nRationale: This sequence is very similar to our best performer but changes the middle BBB to BAA. It maintains the successful start and end sequences while exploring a different distribution of B monomers in the middle.\n\n4. BAABAABAAAABABABAABB\nRationale: Based on the good performance of BAABAABAAAABABABAABA (distance 1.368), we're keeping most of this sequence intact but changing the last A to B. This explores whether a different ending can improve vesicle closure while keeping the successful overall structure.\n\n5. ABABAABAAABBAABAABAA\nRationale: This sequence takes the successful middle and end parts of our best performer (BAABAAABBAABAABAA) but introduces a new start (ABA). This explores whether a different initiation sequence can lead to improved vesicle formation while keeping successful elements from the best performer.\n\nThese sequences are designed to exploit the successful patterns observed in our best performer while also exploring new arrangements. They all maintain the required 12 A monomers and 8 B monomers and are 20 monomers long.\n\nThe proposals consider the principles of polymer self-assembly:\n\n1. The importance of the starting sequence in initiating vesicle formation, with BBA and ABA starts being explored.\n2. The role of B monomers in creating and maintaining curvature throughout the sequence, particularly the BBB motif in the middle of our best performer.\n3. The potential importance of A-rich regions for vesicle wall stability, maintained in all proposals.\n4. The impact of the ending sequence on vesicle closure, with variations of BAA, BAB, and ABA being explored.\n\nThese sequences aim to balance the attractive (A) and repulsive (B) interactions to promote the formation of a stable, closed, hollow structure. We're focusing on refining the patterns that have shown success, particularly from our best performer, while still exploring some variations to potentially find even better solutions. The goal is to create a sequence that initiates proper curvature, maintains it throughout, and allows for proper closure of the vesicle."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired morphology:\nBBABAABAAABBAABAABAB: 9.070\nBBABAABAAABBAABAAABA: 1.727\nBAABAABAAAABABABAABB: 6.406\nABABAABAAABBAABAABAA: 5.390\nABABABBAAABBAABAABAA: 4.300\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.

While we didn't achieve any good solutions in this batch, we can use these insights along with our previous successful sequence (BBABAABAAABBAABAABAA, distance 0.455) to propose new sequences that might bring us closer to the target hollow vesicle structure. Here are five new proposals:\n\n1. BBABAABAAABBAABAABAC\nRationale: This sequence is nearly identical to our previous best performer, with only the last A changed to C. We're exploring if this slight modification at the end can further improve the vesicle structure while maintaining the overall successful pattern.\n\n2. BBABAABAAABBAABAAABB\nRationale: Based on the relatively good performance of BBABAABAAABBAABAAABA (distance 1.727), we're keeping most of this sequence intact but changing the last A to B.
