It's interesting to see that none of our recent proposals improved upon our best solutions, but we have a new sequence (AABBAABBAAAABAABAABA) with a good result of 1.450. Let's explore around this new finding while also keeping our previous best solutions in mind. Here are five new proposals:\n\n1. BABBAABBAAAABAABAABA\nRationale: This is our recent good performer (0.847). Given that our modifications didn't improve it, it's worth re-evaluating to confirm its performance and compare directly with the new finding.\n\n2. AABBAABBAAAABAABAABB\nRationale: This sequence is based on the new good performer (1.450), with only the last 'A' changed to 'B'. This minor modification might fine-tune the vesicle structure while maintaining the overall successful pattern.\n\n3. BABBBAABAAAABAABAABA\nRationale: This is our original optimal sequence (0.000). We should re-evaluate it to compare directly with our recent findings and ensure its performance is still optimal.\n\n4. AABBAABBAAAABAABAAAB\nRationale: This sequence maintains the successful \"AABBAABBAAAA\" start from the new good performer but modifies the end. This explores whether a different arrangement of 'B' monomers at the end can further improve vesicle formation.\n\n5. BAABBAABBAAAABAABAAB\nRationale: This sequence starts with \"BA\" instead of \"AA\" compared to our new good performer, and ends with 'B'. This tests whether slight modifications to both ends can enhance vesicle formation while keeping the successful core.\n\nThese proposals aim to balance exploitation of our known good solutions with continued exploration of the solution space.
