BABBBAABAAAABAABAABB\nReasoning: This sequence is very similar to the known good result, with only the last monomer changed from A to B. This slight modification allows us to explore the nearby solution space and potentially find an even better sequence while maintaining the overall structure that led to a good result.\n\n2. BABBBAABAAAABAABABAA\nReasoning: This sequence maintains the general pattern of the good result but shifts some of the A and B monomers slightly. The core BABBBA... pattern is preserved at the beginning, which might be crucial for forming the hollow vesicle structure. The slight rearrangement of A and B monomers towards the end allows us to explore how small changes affect the morphology.\n\n3. ABABBBAABAAAABAABAAB\nReasoning: This sequence starts with an A monomer instead of a B, but otherwise closely resembles the good result.

BAABBBAABAAAABAABABA\nReasoning: This sequence redistributes the B monomers more evenly throughout the chain while maintaining some similarities to the good result. This approach helps us explore whether a more uniform distribution of repulsive monomers can still achieve the desired morphology, potentially by creating a different balance of attractive and repulsive interactions.\n\nThese sequences are designed to balance exploitation of the known good result with exploration of new possibilities.

BABBBABAAAABAABAABAA\nRationale: This sequence is similar to our best solution (0.921) but swaps the positions of two monomers (11th and 19th positions). We're investigating if this minor rearrangement can optimize the vesicle structure while maintaining the overall successful pattern.\n\n5. BABBBBAAAAABAABAAABA\nRationale: This sequence is inspired by the one that scored 1.457 in the last batch (BABBBBBAAAABAABAAABA). We've reduced the number of consecutive B monomers at the start from 4 to 3, which is more similar to our best-performing sequences. We're exploring if this modification can push the performance into the \"good solution\" range.\n\nThese proposals aim to balance exploitation of our best solutions with continued exploration of the sequence space. They all maintain the required 12 A and 8 B monomers and consider the principles of polymer self-assembly. We're focusing on subtle variations of the successful patterns, particularly exploring:\n\n1. Verification of our current best solutions\n2. The distribution of B monomers throughout the sequence\n3. The importance of the exact order in the central region\n4. The effect of consecutive B monomers at the start of the sequence\n\nBy proposing these variations, we hope to fine-tune our understanding of the factors that contribute to successful vesicle formation in this system. We're particularly interested in comparing the performance of our two best-known solutions (0.000 and 0.921) and seeing if we can find any sequences that perform even better. These proposals should help us explore the nearby solution space while also potentially discovering additional high-performing sequences or confirming the robustness of our current best solutions."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired morphology:\nBABBBBAAAAABAABAAABA: 1.444\nBAABBABAAAABAABAAABA: 0.958\nBABBBAAAAAABAABAAABA: 3.438\nAABBBABAAAAABAABAAAB: 5.356\nBAABBAABAAABAAABAABA: 1.960\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.

It's interesting to see that BAABBABAAAABAABAAABA achieved a distance of 0.958, which is a good solution and slightly better than our previous best. Let's use this information to propose five new sequences:\n\n1. BAABBABAAAABAABAAABB\nRationale: This sequence is identical to our new best solution (0.958) except for the last monomer, which we've changed from A to B. We're exploring if this minor modification at the end can further improve the performance by potentially affecting the vesicle closure.\n\n2. BAABBABAAAABAABAABAA\nRationale: This sequence is very similar to our new best solution but swaps the positions of two monomers (11th and 19th positions). We're investigating if this slight rearrangement can optimize the vesicle structure while maintaining the overall successful pattern.\n\n3. BABBBABAAAABAABAAABA\nRationale: This is our previous best solution (0.921). We're including it again to compare it directly with our new best (0.958) and ensure we're not overlooking a potentially better sequence.\n\n4. BAABBAABAAAABAABAABA\nRationale: This sequence combines elements from our new best solution (BAABBA at the start) with elements from our original best solution (ABAAAABAABAABA at the end). We're exploring if this combination can yield an even better result.\n\n5. BBAABBABAAAABAABAAAA\nRationale: This sequence starts with an additional B compared to our new best solution and removes an A from the end. We're examining if this slight shift in B distribution towards the beginning can further improve vesicle formation.\n\nThese proposals aim to balance exploitation of our best solutions with continued exploration of the sequence space.
