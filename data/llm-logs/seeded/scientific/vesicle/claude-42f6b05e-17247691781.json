We've made significant progress with two sequences performing exceptionally well. Let's propose five new sequences based on these insights:\n\n1. BBABAAABAAABABABABAA\nRationale: This sequence is based on our best performer (BBABAAABAAABABABAABA) but shifts the last BA to the front. We're exploring if this slight modification can further improve vesicle formation while maintaining the successful overall structure.\n\n2. BBBBAAABAAABABABAABA\nRationale: This combines elements from our two best performers. It starts with BBBB from the fourth-best sequence and continues with the successful pattern from our top performer. We're testing if increasing the initial hydrophobic region can enhance vesicle formation.\n\n3. BBABAAABAAABABBABAAB\nRationale: This sequence maintains the successful BBABAAABAAAB start from our best performer but introduces a new pattern in the latter half. We're exploring how this change in the terminal region affects vesicle formation.\n\n4. BBBAAAABAAABBAABAABA\nRationale: This sequence is inspired by our fourth-best performer (BBBBAAABAAABBAABAABA) but reduces the initial hydrophobic region from BBBB to BBB. We're testing if this slight reduction in hydrophobicity at the start can improve performance.\n\n5. BBABAAABABABAABAABAA\nRationale: This sequence keeps the successful BBABAAAB start but introduces an alternating ABABA pattern earlier in the sequence. We're exploring how this change in the middle region affects the vesicle structure.\n\nGeneral strategy:\n1. We're heavily exploiting the success of our two top-performing sequences (BBABAAABAAABABABAABA and BBBBAAABAAABBAABAABA) by using them as the basis for most of our new proposals.\n\n2. We're making strategic changes to explore nearby solutions in the parameter space while maintaining key features that seem important for hollow vesicle formation, particularly the BBAB or BBBB start.\n\n3. We're considering the role of monomer sequence in self-assembly, particularly how the arrangement of attractive (A) and repulsive (B) beads at different positions might affect the morphology.\n\n4. We're applying principles of polymer self-assembly by considering how the balance and distribution of hydrophobic (B) and hydrophilic (A) monomers influence the curvature and stability of the vesicle structure.\n\n5. We're maintaining some diversity in our proposals to avoid getting trapped in a local minimum, especially by exploring variations in the middle region and the terminal monomers.\n\n6. We're focusing on sequences that start with at least three B monomers, as this pattern has been consistent in our best performers.\n\n7.
