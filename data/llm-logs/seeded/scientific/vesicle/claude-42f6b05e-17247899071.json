We're getting much closer with several sequences now, particularly ABABBBAABAAABAABABAA (distance 1.851) and AABABBBAABAAABAAABBA (distance 1.862). Let's focus on refining these promising sequences while still exploring nearby solution spaces. Here are five new sequences with explanations:\n\n1. ABABBBAABAAABAABABAB\nRationale: This sequence is almost identical to our best performer (ABABBBAABAAABAABABAA), with only the last A changed to B. This subtle change might affect the closure of the vesicle and potentially improve its stability.\n\n2. AABABBBAABAAABAAABAB\nRationale: Based on our second-best performer (AABABBBAABAAABAAABBA), this sequence changes the final A to B. This might create a different hydrophobic effect at the end, potentially improving vesicle formation.\n\n3. ABABBBAABAAABAABAABA\nRationale: This sequence combines elements from our best performers, maintaining the ABABBBA... start and incorporating the BAABA pattern that has shown promise. This might create an optimal balance between initial folding and final vesicle structure.\n\n4. AABABBBAABAAABAABABA\nRationale: This sequence starts with AABABBBA... (which has performed well) and incorporates the successful BAABA pattern from our best performer. The alternating A-B at the end might fine-tune the vesicle closure.\n\n5. BABABBBAABAAABAABABA\nRationale: This sequence explores a variation by starting with BA instead of AB, while maintaining the overall successful pattern. This change at the beginning might influence the initial folding direction while keeping the promising latter part of the sequence.\n\nThese proposals aim to exploit the success of our best-performing sequences while still exploring nearby solution spaces.
