We're making progress with the sequence ABABBBBAAAAABAABAAAB (2.174), which is getting closer to our target range. Let's use this insight to guide our next proposals:\n\n1. ABABBBBAAAAABAABAAAA\nRationale: This sequence is based on our closest result (2.174), with the last B changed to A. We're exploring whether increasing hydrophilicity at the end might further improve vesicle formation.\n\n2. BABBBBABAAAABAABAABA\nRationale: This sequence is our previous best result (1.241).
