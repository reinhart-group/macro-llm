We're focusing on fine-tuning the successful sequence, particularly exploring how small changes affect the vesicle formation.\n\n2. The variations in the start and end sections explore how different distributions of A and B monomers affect the initiation and closure of the vesicle structure.\n\n3. We're maintaining the core AAABAAABAB... section in the middle, which seems to be crucial for the successful formation of the vesicle, possibly providing the right balance of attractive and repulsive interactions.\n\n4. The balance between hydrophobic (B) and hydrophilic (A) interactions is maintained, which is crucial for driving the self-assembly process towards a hollow vesicle morphology.\n\n5. We're exploring how slight changes in the position of B monomers might affect the overall curvature and stability of the vesicle.\n\nThese proposals aim to exploit the success of our best-performing sequence while also introducing some variations to potentially uncover even better sequences for optimal vesicle formation.

It appears that we've taken a step back from our previous best result. However, we can still use these insights to guide our next proposals. Let's propose five new sequences:\n\n1. ABABBAAABAAABABAABAA\nRationale: This sequence reverts to our previously best-performing sequence (distance 0.441). Given that recent variations haven't improved results, it's worth revisiting this sequence as a baseline and to explore nearby variations.\n\n2. ABABBAAABAAABABAABA\nRationale: This sequence is identical to our best performer but removes the last A. This slight modification might help fine-tune the vesicle structure while maintaining the overall successful pattern. It also explores whether a 19-monomer sequence could be effective.\n\n3.
