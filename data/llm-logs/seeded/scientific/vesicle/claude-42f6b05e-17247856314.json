It aims to explore a different distribution of hydrophobic regions while maintaining key features that have led to good results.\n\nThese sequences are designed to exploit the successful patterns observed in the best-performing sequence (BABAAABBAAAABAABAABA) and other previously successful sequences, while also exploring new arrangements that might lead to improved vesicle formation. The proposals maintain the required balance of 12 'A' and 8 'B' monomers and avoid duplicating previously evaluated sequences.\n\nBy focusing on modifications to the start, middle, and end regions of the polymer, we aim to fine-tune the self-assembly process. These changes may affect the initial aggregation stages, the curvature of the forming vesicles, and the overall stability of the structure.\n\nThe emphasis in these proposals is on maintaining a balance between clustered hydrophobic regions (BB) and extended hydrophilic regions (AAA or AAAA), which has proven successful in the previous iterations. This approach is based on the principle that such arrangements can promote the formation of curved structures in amphiphilic polymers, leading to stable and well-defined hollow vesicles.\n\nThe goal remains to optimize the interplay between hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions to achieve the desired morphology in the coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, building upon the success of the previous iterations while still exploring the nearby solution space.
