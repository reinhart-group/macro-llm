While we didn't find a new solution below the 1.34 threshold, we have a promising sequence with BAABBABAAAABAABAABAA achieving a distance of 1.478. Let's build upon these insights and explore nearby sequences while also maintaining some diversity in our proposals.\n\n1. BAABBABAAAABAABAABAB\nReasoning: This sequence is nearly identical to our best performer from this batch, with only the last monomer changed from A to B. This slight modification aims to explore the immediate neighborhood of the promising solution and potentially improve vesicle stability.\n\n2. BAABBABAAAABAABAAABA\nReasoning: This sequence maintains the successful start of our best performer but slightly alters the distribution of A and B monomers in the latter half. This explores how a minor change in the hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance affects vesicle formation.\n\n3. BAABAABAAAABAABAABAA\nReasoning: This sequence reintroduces our previous good performer (with a distance of 0.740). By bringing it back, we can compare its performance directly with our new promising solution and potentially find an even better configuration.\n\n4.
