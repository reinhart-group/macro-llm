We've made excellent progress with two sequences below the 1.34 threshold. Let's build upon these insights to propose five new sequences:\n\n1. BBBBAABBAAAABAABAABB\nRationale: This sequence is based on the second-best performer (0.897), with only the last A changed to B. We're exploring if this slight modification at the end can further improve vesicle formation while maintaining the successful core structure.\n\n2. BABBBBABAAAABAABAABB\nRationale: This is derived from the best performer (1.241), changing the last A to B. We're investigating if this small change can push the performance even lower while maintaining the successful overall pattern.\n\n3. ABBBAABBAAAABAABAABA\nRationale: This sequence takes the core of our second-best performer (0.897) but starts with A instead of BBB. We're exploring if this change in hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance at the start can lead to improved vesicle formation.\n\n4. BABBBBABAAAABAABAAAB\nRationale: This sequence keeps the successful \"BABBBBA\" start from our best performer (1.241) but rearranges the latter part. We're investigating if this new distribution of hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions can enhance vesicle structure.\n\n5. ABABABAABAAAABAABAAA\nRationale: This is based on the third-best performer (2.170), changing the last B to A. We're exploring if increasing the hydrophilic nature at the end can push this sequence below the 1.34 threshold.\n\nThese proposals aim to:\n1. Exploit the success of the \"BBBBAABB\" and \"BABBBBAB\" starts in top-performing sequences.\n2. Investigate the impact of slight modifications to the end of successful sequences.\n3. Explore new distributions of hydrophobic (B) and hydrophilic (A) monomers, particularly at the beginning and end of the sequence.\n4. Balance between exploiting known good solutions and exploring new variations.\n\nBy making these targeted modifications, we hope to fine-tune the vesicle formation process and potentially discover sequences that perform even better than our current top performers. These proposals consider the principles of polymer self-assembly, focusing on:\n\n1. The importance of a hydrophobic-rich start (BBB or BABBB) in successful sequences.\n2. The role of the \"AABAABAA\" pattern towards the end in good performers.\n3. The potential impact of the terminal monomer on overall folding and vesicle formation.\n4. The balance between hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions throughout the sequence.\n\nWe're aiming to optimize the self-assembly process for hollow vesicle formation by carefully adjusting the distribution and arrangement of hydrophobic (B) and hydrophilic (A) monomers."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired morphology:\nBBBBAABBAAAABAABAABB: 6.326\nBABBBBABAAAABAABAABB: 6.264\nABBBAABBAAAABAABAABA: 1.627\nBABBBBABAAAABAABAAAB: 5.645\nABABABAABAAAABAABAAA: 2.304\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
