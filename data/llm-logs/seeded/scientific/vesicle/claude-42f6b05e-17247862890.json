It's interesting to note that none of our recent proposals achieved a distance below 1.34. Let's use these insights and our previous successful results to guide our next set of proposals.\n\n1. BABBBAABAAAABAABAABA\nRationale: We're reintroducing this sequence, which previously gave us a perfect result (distance 0.000). Given that our recent variations haven't improved upon our best results, it's crucial to verify the consistent performance of this sequence and use it as a benchmark.\n\n2. BABABAABAAAABAABAABA\nRationale: This sequence gave us an excellent result earlier (distance 0.257). We're proposing it again to confirm its performance and compare it with our new variations.\n\n3. BABBBAABAAAABAABAAAB\nRationale: This sequence combines the successful BABBB start from our best performer with a rearrangement of the latter part. It aims to maintain the core structure that led to perfect results while exploring if slight variations can produce other good solutions.\n\n4. BABABBAABAAABAABAAAB\nRationale: This sequence incorporates the alternating BABAB pattern that has shown promise, followed by a double B, and then a distribution of A and B monomers similar to our successful sequences. This explores whether a slight increase in B monomers near the start can enhance the vesicle structure.\n\n5. BBABABAABAAABAABAAAB\nRationale: This sequence starts with a double B, followed by the successful BABABA pattern, and then continues with a distribution similar to our good performers. This explores whether having two B monomers at the very beginning, followed by the alternating pattern, can lead to effective vesicle formation.\n\nThese sequences are designed to exploit the successful elements identified in our best performers (particularly the BABBB and BABABA patterns at the start) while also exploring new variations that might lead to other good solutions or improvements.
