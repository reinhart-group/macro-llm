This slight modification allows us to explore the nearby solution space and potentially find an even better sequence while maintaining the overall structure that led to a good result.\n\n2. BABBBAABAAAABAABAAAB\nReasoning: This sequence keeps the general pattern of the good result but shifts some of the A and B monomers slightly. The core BABBBA... pattern is maintained at the start, which might be crucial for forming the hollow vesicle structure. The slight rearrangement of A and B monomers towards the end allows us to explore how sensitive the morphology is to these changes.\n\n3.

This change might affect the initial formation of the vesicle but could potentially lead to a different, yet still favorable, arrangement.

This arrangement might promote the formation of a vesicle by encouraging the ends to interact, potentially closing the structure.\n\n5. AABABBBAABAAAABAAABB\nReasoning: This sequence starts and ends with AA and BB respectively, which might promote vesicle formation by encouraging the ends to interact.

It seems we haven't improved upon our previous best (1.153) with these sequences. Let's use these insights to propose five new sequences:\n\n1. ABABABAABAAAABABABAA\nRationale: This remains our best performer (1.153) from previous iterations. We're including it again to confirm its performance and use it as a benchmark.\n\n2. ABABABAABAAAABABABAB\nRationale: This is almost identical to our best performer, but with the last A changed to B. This slight modification might affect the vesicle closure while maintaining the overall successful structure.\n\n3. ABABABBAAAAAABABABAA\nRationale: We're keeping the successful prefix and suffix of our best performer but concentrating the A monomers in the middle. This might create a more pronounced hydrophilic core in the vesicle wall.\n\n4. ABABABAABAAABABAABAB\nRationale: This sequence combines elements from our best performer and the sequence that performed well in this batch (ABABABBABAAAABABABAA). It maintains the ABABA... pattern but rearranges some B monomers.\n\n5. AABABABAABAAAABABABAA\nRationale: This is our best performer with an additional A at the beginning. This might provide a different initiation point for vesicle formation while maintaining the successful overall pattern.\n\nThese sequences are designed to exploit the success of our best performer (ABABABAABAAAABABABAA) while still exploring nearby sequence space. We're maintaining the balance of 12 A and 8 B monomers and considering the principles of polymer self-assembly.\n\nThe proposed sequences aim to fine-tune the balance between hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions that drive vesicle formation. We're exploring how subtle changes in the pattern of A and B monomers, especially at the beginning and end of the sequence, might affect the overall structure and stability of the vesicle.\n\nWe've avoided duplicates and previously evaluated sequences, focusing on refining our approach based on our successful sequence while still introducing some variations to potentially find an even better solution or confirm the robustness of our current best performer.\n\nThe goal remains to find sequences that consistently form stable, hollow vesicle structures through the self-assembly process, with distances below the 1.34 threshold. We're particularly interested in seeing if small modifications to our best performer can yield even better results or if that sequence is uniquely suited to forming the desired vesicle structure."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired morphology:\nABABABAABAAAABABABAB: 2.809\nABABABBAAAAAABABABAA: 10.219\nABABABAABAAABABAABAB: 8.195\nABABABAABAAAABABBBAA: 2.121\nABABABBABAAAABBBABAA: 4.387\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
