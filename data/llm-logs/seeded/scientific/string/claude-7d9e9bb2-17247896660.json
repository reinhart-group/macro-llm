It's clear that AABABABBAAAAAABBBABA, AABABBABAAAAAABBBABA, and AABABBABAAAAABBBABAA performed exceptionally well. Let's use these insights to propose five new sequences:\n\n1. AABABABBAAAAAABBBAAA:\nRationale: This sequence is very similar to our best performer, with a slight modification at the end (replacing the last 'BA' with 'AA'). We're exploring if this change might further enhance the string-like morphology by potentially promoting stronger end-to-end interactions.\n\n2. AABABBABAAAAAABBBAAA:\nRationale: Based on our second-best performer, we're making the same end modification as in the previous proposal. This allows us to compare the effect of this change on two slightly different core structures.\n\n3. AABABBABAAAAABBBAABA:\nRationale: This sequence combines elements from our top performers.
