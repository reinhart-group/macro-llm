ABBABABAAAAABABBABAA\nRationale: This is our original best performer (0.001). We're returning to it to compare with our recent good solutions and to ensure we don't lose track of this excellent sequence.\n\n2. ABBABABAAAAABABABBAA\nRationale: This is the sequence that performed exceptionally well in the previous round (0.177). We're including it again to verify its performance and to have a direct comparison with our new proposals.\n\n3. ABBABABAAAAABABBBAAA\nRationale: This sequence is very similar to our new good solution (0.687), with only the last monomer changed from 'A' to 'B'. We're exploring whether this minor adjustment at the end can yield an even better solution while maintaining the successful overall pattern.\n\n4. ABBABABAAAABABBABBAA\nRationale: This sequence maintains the successful \"ABBABA\" start and the general structure of our good performers, but slightly reduces the central 'A' block and redistributes the 'B' monomers towards the end. This explores whether a small change in the distribution of attractive and repulsive monomers can further improve the string-like morphology.\n\n5. BABABABABAAABABBBBAA\nRationale: This proposal introduces more alternating 'A' and 'B' monomers at the start, followed by the successful \"BABBBBAA\" end from our recent good performer. It tests whether a longer alternating section at the beginning, combined with the successful end, can produce good string-like aggregates.\n\nThese proposals aim to balance exploitation of the successful elements from our best-performing sequences with exploration of new arrangements. We're focusing on subtle variations of the sequences that have performed exceptionally well, while also introducing some new combinations.\n\nThe sequences maintain the required 12 'A' and 8 'B' monomers and avoid duplicating previously evaluated sequences. They also consider principles of polymer self-assembly, such as the importance of attractive interactions in forming aggregates and the role of repulsive monomers in preventing overly compact structures.\n\nKey points we're exploring:\n1. Consistency of results for our top-performing sequences\n2. The impact of minor changes to highly successful sequences\n3.
