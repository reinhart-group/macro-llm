Although none of the sequences in this batch met the \"good solution\" criteria, we can still use these insights along with our previous successful results to propose new sequences.

AABBABABAAAAABABBABA: 0.341 (Best overall result)\n\nBased on these insights, here are five new proposed sequences:\n\n1. AABBABABAAAAABABBBAA\nRationale: This sequence combines elements from our two best results, maintaining the successful \"AABBABABAAAA\" start and modifying the end to \"BABBBAA\". It explores whether shifting the position of the \"BBB\" block can further optimize the string-like structure.\n\n2. AABBABAAAAAABABBBABA\nRationale: We keep the successful \"AABBA\" start and \"BBBABA\" end pattern but extend the central \"A\" block to six monomers. This tests whether a longer attractive segment in the middle, combined with the successful end patterns, can improve string-like aggregation.\n\n3. AABBABAABAAAABABBAAA\nRationale: This sequence maintains the \"AABBA\" start and introduces a \"BA\" pair before the central \"AAAA\" block, similar to a previous proposal. However, it ends with \"BAAA\", which has shown promise in earlier batches. It explores a different balance of attractive and repulsive interactions throughout the chain.\n\n4. AABBABABAAAABABBABAA\nRationale: We use the successful \"AABBABA\" start and \"BABAA\" end from our best overall result but reduce the central \"A\" block to three monomers. This tests whether a slightly shorter attractive segment in the middle can still maintain or improve the desired morphology.\n\n5. AAABBABABAAAABBBABAA\nRationale: This sequence starts with \"AAA\", which has shown promise in some earlier batches, followed by the successful \"BBABA\" pattern. It maintains the \"BBBA\" pattern near the end, which was present in our recent good result. This explores whether increasing initial attractive interactions can enhance string-like aggregate formation.\n\nThese proposals aim to balance exploitation of successful patterns with careful exploration of nearby sequence space.
