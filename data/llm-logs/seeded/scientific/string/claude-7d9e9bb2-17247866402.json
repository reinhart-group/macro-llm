We've found three more good solutions, with one matching our previous best performance. This is excellent progress. Let's use these insights to guide our next proposals:\n\n1. AABBABABAAAAABABABAA\nRationale: This sequence is very similar to our best performer \"AABBABABAAAAABABABBA\", but ends with 'AA' instead of 'BA'. This slight modification might fine-tune the end interactions while maintaining the overall successful structure that promotes string-like aggregates.\n\n2. AABBABABAAAAABABBBBA\nRationale: This sequence keeps the successful start \"AABBABABAAAA\" and combines it with the end \"BABBBBA\", which is similar to some of our good solutions. This might create a different balance of attractive and repulsive interactions at the end while preserving the successful start.\n\n3. AABBABABAAAABBBABABA\nRationale: This sequence maintains the successful \"AABBABABA\" start but introduces a cluster of three 'B's in the middle, followed by \"BABABA\". This explores whether a more pronounced repulsive section in the middle can improve performance while maintaining elements from successful sequences.\n\n4. AABBABABAAAAABBAABBA\nRationale: This sequence combines the successful start \"AABBABABAAAA\" with a new end pattern \"BBAABBA\". This arrangement might create interesting end-to-end interactions that could influence the overall structure while keeping the successful beginning.\n\n5. AABBABAAAAABABABBBAA\nRationale: This sequence starts with \"AABBA\", has a longer stretch of 'A's, and then follows with \"BABABBBAA\". This explores whether a longer attractive core combined with a more varied end can improve performance while still maintaining elements from successful sequences.\n\nThese proposals aim to balance exploitation of our successful sequences with careful exploration of variations that might yield even better results.
