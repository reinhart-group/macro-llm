This explores whether changing the last two monomers can further improve the string-like morphology.\n\n3.

It tests whether a longer repulsive segment at the beginning can enhance string formation.\n\n4. ABBABBBAAAABABABBAA:\nWe're reducing the central 'A' cluster and redistributing some 'A' monomers.
