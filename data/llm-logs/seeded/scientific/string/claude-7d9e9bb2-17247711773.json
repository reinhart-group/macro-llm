We've made excellent progress with BABABBBAAAAABABABBAA achieving a distance of 0.975, which is our best solution so far. Let's build upon this insight and propose five new sequences:\n\n1. BABABBBAAAAABABABBAB\nRationale: This sequence is nearly identical to our new best solution, with only the last monomer changed from 'A' to 'B'.
