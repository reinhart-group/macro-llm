We've found two excellent new solutions: AABBBBABAAAAABABBAAB (distance 0.708) and AAABBBBABAAAAABABBAB (distance 0.593). These results provide valuable insights for our next proposals. Let's use this information to propose five new sequences:\n\n1. AAABBBBABAAAAABABAAB\nRationale: This sequence combines elements from our two best solutions. It starts with \"AAABBBBABA\" from the best performer, maintains the central \"AAAA\" block, and ends with \"BABAAB\" from the second-best solution. This explores whether combining these successful elements can further improve the string-like character.\n\n2. AAABBBBABAAAAAABBABA\nRationale: This sequence keeps the successful \"AAABBBBABA\" start but extends the central 'A' block to five monomers. The end is modified to \"ABBABA\". This explores whether a longer central attractive core can enhance string-like aggregation while maintaining the successful start.\n\n3. AABBBBABAAAAABABBABA\nRationale: This sequence is our previously discovered good solution (distance 1.039). We're including it again to compare with our new good solutions and ensure we don't lose this performer, as it has a slightly different pattern that might still yield insights.\n\n4. AAABBBABABAAAABABBAB\nRationale: This sequence starts with \"AAA\" like our best performer but reduces the consecutive 'B' count from three to two. It maintains the central \"AAAA\" block and ends with \"BABBAB\". This explores whether a slight reduction in the initial repulsive segment affects the string-like morphology while keeping the successful \"AAA\" start.\n\n5. AAAABBBABAAAAABABBAB\nRationale: This sequence extends the initial 'A' segment to four monomers, followed by the \"BBBABA\" pattern. The central \"AAAA\" block and \"BABBAB\" end are maintained. This explores whether increasing the initial attractive segment further enhances the formation of string-like aggregates.\n\nThese sequences aim to balance exploitation of known good solutions with controlled exploration of new arrangements. They all maintain the required ratio of 12 'A' and 8 'B' monomers while investigating different distributions of attractive and repulsive interactions. The variations focus on:\n\n1. Combining elements from our two best solutions.\n2. Exploring the impact of a longer central 'A' block.\n3. Comparing with our previously discovered good solution.\n4.

We've found an excellent new solution: AABABBABAAAAABABBAAB (distance 0.294), which is our best performer so far. Let's use this information to propose five new sequences:\n\n1. AABABBABAAAAABABBAAA\nRationale: This sequence is nearly identical to our best performer, with only the last 'B' changed to 'A'. This slight modification explores whether increasing the attractive interactions at the very end can further enhance the string-like character while maintaining the overall successful structure.\n\n2. AABABBABAAAAAABBAAB\nRationale: This sequence keeps the successful \"AABABBA\" start from our best performer but extends the central 'A' block to five monomers. The end is slightly modified to \"ABBAAB\". This explores whether a longer central attractive core can improve string-like aggregation while maintaining the successful start and end patterns.\n\n3. AAABABBABAAAAABABBAB\nRationale: This sequence adds an extra 'A' at the beginning of our best performer. The rest of the sequence remains the same. This explores whether increasing the initial attractive segment affects the formation of string-like aggregates while keeping the overall successful pattern.\n\n4. AABABBABAAAAABABBABA\nRationale: This sequence is identical to our best performer except for the last monomer, which is changed from 'B' to 'A'. This subtle change explores whether a slightly more attractive end group can further improve the string-like morphology.\n\n5. BABABBABAAAAAABBAAB\nRationale: This sequence starts with 'B' followed by the pattern \"ABABBA\" from our best performer. It maintains a central \"AAAAA\" block and ends with \"ABBAAB\". By starting with 'B', we explore whether creating a small repulsive end promotes the formation of multiple string-like aggregates while keeping elements of our successful sequence.\n\nThese sequences aim to balance exploitation of our new best solution with controlled exploration of new arrangements.
