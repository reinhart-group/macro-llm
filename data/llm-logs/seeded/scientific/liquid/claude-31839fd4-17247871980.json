We have one sequence within the good solution range, with a distance of 0.876. Based on these insights, I'll propose five new sequences:\n\n1. BAABABABAABAABABAABB\nRationale: This sequence is very similar to the best performer (0.876), with only the last 'A' changed to 'B'. This slight modification might further optimize the balance between attractive and repulsive interactions at the end of the chain, potentially improving the formation of amorphous liquid droplets.\n\n2. ABAABABABAABAABABAAB\nRationale: This sequence maintains the successful central and end portions of the best performer but starts with 'ABA' instead of 'BAA'. This change at the beginning might affect the initial self-assembly process while keeping the beneficial pattern in the rest of the sequence.\n\n3. BAABABABAABAABABAABA\nRationale: Building on the success of the best performer, this sequence slightly modifies the central portion by changing 'ABABA' to 'ABAABA'. This subtle shift in the balance of attractive and repulsive interactions in the middle of the sequence might further improve the result.\n\n4. BAABABABABAABAABAAAB\nRationale: This sequence introduces a longer 'BABABA' pattern in the first half while maintaining elements of the successful sequence in the second half. This arrangement might create a more diverse distribution of attractive and repulsive interactions along the polymer chain.\n\n5. ABAABABABAABAABAABAB\nRationale: This sequence combines the successful 'ABABA' motifs from the best performer with 'ABAABA' patterns. By alternating these patterns, we explore whether this can enhance the formation of amorphous liquid droplets while maintaining a balance of attractive and repulsive interactions.\n\nThese proposals aim to exploit the patterns observed in the successful sequence (0.876) while also exploring new variations.
