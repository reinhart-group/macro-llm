We've found two good solutions in this batch, which is excellent progress. Let's build upon these insights to propose five new sequences:\n\n1. BAABAABBABAABABAABAA\nRationale: This sequence is very similar to the best performer (0.628 distance), with a slight modification at the end. We're exploiting this highly successful pattern while exploring a minor variation that might further optimize the structure for amorphous liquid droplets.\n\n2. BBAABAABAABABABAABAA\nRationale: This sequence is based on the second-best performer (1.010 distance), with a small change at the end. We're maintaining the overall structure that has shown promise while introducing a subtle variation.\n\n3. BAABAABBABAABABAABBA\nRationale: This sequence is another variation of the best performer, changing the last two monomers. This slight modification might provide insights into how the end of the sequence affects droplet formation.\n\n4. BBAABAABAABABABAABAB\nRationale: This sequence combines elements from both good performers. It starts with the 'BB' from the second-best sequence but incorporates the 'ABAABA' motif from the best performer. This hybrid approach might yield a favorable balance of interactions.\n\n5. BAABAABAABBABAABABAB\nRationale: This sequence maintains the successful 'BAABAA' start and incorporates elements from the best performer, but in a slightly different arrangement. This rearrangement might create a subtle change in the distribution of attractive and repulsive interactions.\n\nKey considerations in these designs:\n\n1. Heavily exploiting the patterns from the two good performers (distances 0.628 and 1.010) as a foundation for new sequences.\n2. Maintaining the 'BAABAA' or 'BBAABAA' motifs at the start, which have been common in good performers.\n3. Exploring subtle variations in the distribution of 'B' monomers, especially in the middle and end of the sequence.\n4. Keeping a higher concentration of 'A' monomers overall to promote attractive interactions necessary for droplet formation.\n5.
