It appears we're still struggling to find sequences that perform better than our previous best. Let's refocus our efforts once again, drawing on our cumulative insights. Here are five new proposals:\n\n1. BAABBAABAABAABBABAAB\nRationale: This sequence is our previous best performer (0.512) that hasn't been tested in the last two batches. Given our recent difficulties in finding better sequences, it's crucial to reconfirm the performance of this sequence and use it as a benchmark.\n\n2. BAABAABBAABAABABAABB\nRationale: This is another previous top performer (0.816) that wasn't tested in the last two batches. Retesting this sequence will help us understand if there's any consistency in performance and provide a solid basis for further optimization.\n\n3. BAABBAABAABAABABAABB\nRationale: This sequence combines elements from our two previously best-performing sequences (0.512 and 0.816). It maintains the 'BAABBAA' motif at the beginning, which has been consistently present in good performers, and incorporates the latter half of the sequence that gave us 0.816. This hybrid approach might yield a sequence that performs better than either of its \"parent\" sequences.\n\n4. BAABAABAABAABAABBAAB\nRationale: This sequence revisits a pattern that performed well earlier in our optimization process (0.218). By reintroducing this sequence, we can check if it still performs well and potentially break out of any local optima we might have fallen into.\n\n5. BAABAABAABAABBABABAB\nRationale: This sequence performed well (1.275) in a previous iteration but wasn't retested. It maintains the 'BAABAA' pattern that has been successful and introduces more alternation between 'A' and 'B' at the end. This design aims to balance attractive and repulsive interactions while potentially promoting more local mixing at the chain ends.\n\nThese proposals aim to refocus our search by revisiting our most successful sequences from previous iterations, particularly those with the 'BAABBAA' or 'BAABAA' motifs that have appeared in many top-performing sequences. We're also exploring combinations of successful elements from different high-performing sequences.\n\nThe goal remains to fine-tune the balance between attractive and repulsive interactions to promote the formation of amorphous liquid droplets. By reexamining our best performers from throughout the optimization process, we hope to overcome the recent plateau in performance and identify more stable and optimal solutions. \n\nThis approach balances exploitation of known good sequences with careful exploration of hybrid designs. It also helps us verify the consistency of performance for our best sequences, which is crucial given the variability we've observed in recent results. By revisiting these successful patterns, we aim to either confirm their effectiveness or identify new directions for optimization."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired morphology:\nBAABBAABAABAABABAABB: 1.679\nBAABBAABAABBABBABAAB: 1.126\nBAABABBBAABAABABAABA: 1.152\nBAABAAAAABAABAABBAAB: 6.297\nBAABAABAABBABBABABAB: 1.457\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
