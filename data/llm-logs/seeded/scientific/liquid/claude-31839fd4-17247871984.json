These results offer valuable insights, particularly with the excellent performance of BAABAABABAABAABAABAB.

BAABAABABAABAABAABBA\nRationale: This sequence is very similar to the best performer (BAABAABABAABAABAABAB) but moves the last 'B' to the end. This subtle change explores how a hydrophobic terminus affects the droplet formation while maintaining the highly successful overall pattern. It may influence the balance between attractive and repulsive interactions at the chain end.\n\n2. BAABAABAABABAABAABAB\nRationale: Inspired by the best performer, this sequence maintains the overall distribution of 'B' monomers but adjusts their positions slightly. By moving one 'B' earlier in the sequence, we investigate how small changes in the hydrophobic distribution affect the self-assembly process and final structure.\n\n3. BAABAABABABAABAABABA\nRationale: This sequence keeps the successful \"BAAB\" motifs at the beginning and introduces more alternating \"ABA\" patterns in the latter half. This explores how a more evenly distributed hydrophobic region in the second half of the chain impacts the overall morphology.\n\n4.

By making this small adjustment, we explore how subtle changes in the hydrophobic distribution at the terminus affect the local interactions and overall morphology while keeping the majority of the chain identical to the successful sequence.\n\nThese proposals aim to balance exploitation of the highly successful pattern observed in BAABAABABAABAABAABAB with exploration of nearby parameter space.
