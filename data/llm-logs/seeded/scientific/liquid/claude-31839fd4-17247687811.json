We've made good progress with two sequences showing distances less than 1.34. Let's build upon these insights to propose five new sequences:\n\n1. BAABAABBABAABAABABAB\nRationale: This sequence is very similar to the best performer (0.629), with only the last 'A' changed to 'B'. This slight modification might further optimize the structure by adjusting the balance of attractive and repulsive interactions at the end.\n\n2. BBABAABAABAABABAABAA\nRationale: This sequence is based on the second-best performer (0.859), but with the last 'B' changed to 'A'. It explores whether increasing attractive interactions at the end can improve performance while maintaining the successful overall structure.\n\n3. BAABAABAABAABAABABBA\nRationale: This sequence returns to a previously successful pattern (which had a distance of 0.616 in an earlier batch). It maintains the \"BAABAABAABAA\" start that has been common in good performers and explores a slightly different end configuration.\n\n4. BAABAABBABAABAABBAAA\nRationale: Based on the best performer (0.629), this sequence keeps the successful middle part but changes the last 'B' to 'A'. It investigates how this small change in end-group composition affects the overall morphology.\n\n5. BBABAABAABAABAABAABB\nRationale: This sequence starts like the second-best performer (0.859) but has a different arrangement of 'B' monomers in the latter half. It explores whether redistributing the 'B' monomers can maintain or improve performance.\n\nThese proposals aim to exploit the successful patterns we've observed in the top-performing sequences while still allowing for some exploration. We're focusing on:\n\n1. The importance of the \"BAABAA\" or \"BBABAA\" patterns at the start of the sequence.\n2. Fine-tuning the distribution of 'B' monomers, especially in the latter half of the sequence.\n3. Exploring minor variations in end group compositions.\n\nBy making these subtle variations, we're investigating how small changes in the sequence can affect the self-assembly process and resulting morphology.
