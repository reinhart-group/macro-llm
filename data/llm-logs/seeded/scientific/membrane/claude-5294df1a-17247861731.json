ABAAABBAAAABBAABBAAA\nReasoning: This sequence is very similar to the known good result (ABAAABBAAAABBABBBAAA), with a slight modification in the last quarter. By moving one 'B' bead closer to the end, we might encourage a slight curvature that could enhance sheet formation while maintaining the overall structure that led to a good result.\n\n2.

ABAAABBAAAAABBABBAAA\nReasoning: This sequence maintains a similar overall structure to the good result but redistributes some of the 'B' beads.

We've made excellent progress with the sequence AABAAABBAAAAABBBABBA (distance 0.153), which is now our best performer. We also have two other good solutions: AABAAABBAAAAABBBBABA (distance 0.602) and AABAAABBAAAAABBABBBB (distance 1.205). Let's build upon these insights for our next proposals:\n\n1. AABAAABBAAAAABBBAABA\nRationale: This sequence is very similar to our best performer but swaps the positions of the last two beads. This minor change might fine-tune the hydrophobic interactions at the end, potentially enhancing sheet formation while maintaining the overall successful structure.\n\n2. AABAAABBAAAAABBBABAA\nRationale: This sequence maintains the successful pattern of our best performer but moves the last 'B' bead to the second-to-last position. This might create a slightly different balance of hydrophobic interactions at the tail, which could influence sheet formation.\n\n3. AABAAABBAAAABBBABBA\nRationale: This sequence keeps the successful beginning and end of our best performer but reduces the consecutive 'A' beads in the middle. This might create a more balanced distribution of hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions throughout the polymer, potentially improving sheet-like assembly.\n\n4. AABAAABBAAAAABBABBBA\nRationale: This sequence combines elements from our previous good performers. It maintains the successful \"AABAAABBAAAAABBA\" pattern and ends with \"BBBA\", which might create a stronger hydrophobic region at the tail, potentially enhancing sheet formation.\n\n5. AABAAABBAAAABBBBABBA\nRationale: This sequence is inspired by our best performer but groups four 'B' beads together near the end. This might create an even stronger localized hydrophobic region that could drive sheet formation while maintaining the overall successful pattern.\n\nThese proposals aim to exploit the patterns observed in our best-performing sequences while introducing small, strategic variations.
