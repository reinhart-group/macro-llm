It appears that our previous batch performed poorly, with all sequences having distances much higher than our target of 1.34. This suggests that starting sequences with long stretches of 'A' beads is not conducive to forming sheet-like membranes. Let's refocus our strategy based on these insights and our previous successes. Here are five new proposals:\n\n1. ABAAABBAAAAABBABBBAA\nRationale: This sequence was our best performer from two batches ago (distance 0.564). Given that our recent explorations didn't yield good results, it's crucial to revisit this highly successful sequence as a baseline for further optimization.\n\n2. ABAAABBAAAAABABBBAAA\nRationale: This sequence was our second-best performer (distance 0.877) from two batches ago. Revisiting this sequence allows us to compare and potentially identify key features that lead to good performance.\n\n3. ABAABBAAAAABBABBBAA\nRationale: This sequence is similar to our best performer (0.564) but introduces an additional 'AB' pair near the beginning. This modification might create a more uniform distribution of attractive and repulsive forces across the sheet while maintaining the successful latter half of the sequence.\n\n4. ABAAABBAAAABBABBBAA\nRationale: This sequence is a hybrid of our best performer and previously successful patterns. It slightly reduces the number of consecutive 'A' beads in the middle, which might affect the sheet's thickness or flexibility while maintaining the overall structure that leads to good performance.\n\n5. ABBAABBAAAAABBABBAAA\nRationale: This sequence introduces more alternating 'AB' pairs at the beginning while maintaining the overall structure of successful sequences. It aims to explore if a different distribution of attractive and repulsive interactions in the first half can further improve sheet properties.\n\nThese proposals aim to balance exploitation of previously successful patterns with careful exploration of new arrangements. They all maintain the required 12 'A' and 8 'B' beads while investigating subtle variations that might influence sheet formation in the Kremer-Grest polymer model.\n\nKey considerations in these proposals:\n\n1. Avoiding long stretches of 'A' beads at the beginning, which seemed to perform poorly in the last batch.\n2. Maintaining the overall structure of sequences that have performed well in the past.\n3. Exploring minor variations in the distribution of 'AB' pairs, particularly in the first half of the sequence.\n4. Investigating the effect of slight changes in the arrangement of 'B' beads in the latter half of the sequence.\n\nThese sequences aim to refine our understanding of what makes a successful sheet-forming sequence by making strategic changes to known good patterns while avoiding patterns that have consistently performed poorly.
