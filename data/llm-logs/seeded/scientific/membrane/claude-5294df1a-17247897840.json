ABAABBAAAAABBBABBAA\nRationale: Here, we're maintaining the successful middle and end portions (AAAAABBBABBAA) but modifying the start. This explores whether a different initiation sequence can still lead to the desired sheet-like structure while keeping the core that seems to be crucial.\n\n5. ABAAABBAAAAABBBBABAA\nRationale: This sequence is a variation of our third-best performer (ABAAABBAAAAABBBBBBAA). By breaking up the 'B' cluster near the end with an 'A', we're investigating if this can fine-tune the sheet formation while staying close to the successful pattern.\n\nThese proposals aim to exploit the success of our best-performing sequences while carefully exploring nearby variations. In the context of polymer self-assembly and the Kremer-Grest model:\n\n1. We're maintaining the \"ABAAABB\" start in most sequences, as it consistently appears in successful configurations and seems crucial for proper folding initiation.\n\n2. The central stretch of 'A' beads (AAAAA or AAAA) is preserved, as it likely provides a strong attractive core for the sheet structure.\n\n3. The distribution of 'B' beads towards the end (e.g., BBBABB, BBBABA) appears to be important, possibly creating repulsive regions that help define the sheet edge or promote folding.\n\n4. We're carefully balancing the number and distribution of 'A' and 'B' beads to maintain the sheet-like morphology while exploring slight variations that might further optimize the structure.\n\nThese sequences all maintain the required 12 'A' and 8 'B' beads. By focusing on variations close to our most successful sequences, we hope to find additional good solutions and potentially improve upon the current best results. This approach allows us to exploit our current successes while still exploring the nearby solution space for potentially better configurations in the sheet-like membrane formation."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired morphology:\nABAAABBAAAAABBBABBAB: 2.503\nABAAABBAAAAABBBABAAB: 1.821\nABAAABBAAAAABBBBABAA: 0.314\nABAAABBAAAAABBBABBBA: 2.398\nABAAABBAAAAAABBABAAA: 2.605\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
