It seems we're still not achieving good solutions in this batch. Let's try a different approach, combining insights from these results with previously successful patterns from earlier iterations. Here are five new proposals:\n\n1. ABAAABBAAAAABBBAABA\nRationale: This sequence returns to the most successful pattern we've seen so far (combining elements from sequences with distances 0.864 and 1.187 in much earlier batches). Given that recent variations haven't improved performance, it's crucial to revisit this highly successful structure as a baseline and to ensure it's still effective.\n\n2. AAABBAABAAAABBBAABA\nRationale: This sequence modifies the beginning of the previously successful pattern, incorporating the 'AAABBAA' motif seen in some better performers from recent batches. It explores whether this change in the initial hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance can enhance sheet-like membrane formation while maintaining the successful 'BBBAABA' ending.\n\n3. ABAAABBAAAABBAABBAA\nRationale: This sequence is based on previously successful patterns but introduces more alternation between 'A' and 'B' in the latter half. It tests whether a more evenly distributed pattern of hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions in the second half can improve sheet formation while maintaining the successful 'ABAAABBAAAA' beginning.\n\n4. ABAABBAAAAABBAABABA\nRationale: This sequence keeps elements of successful patterns (like 'ABAABBAAAA') but modifies the ending. It tests whether this new arrangement of hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions, particularly the 'ABABA' ending, can improve sheet formation while maintaining key elements from successful sequences.\n\n5.
