ABAAABBAAAABAABBBAA:\nRationale: We've maintained most of the successful sequence but moved one 'A' from the end to create a longer 'B' stretch at the end. This might influence the edge properties of the sheet while preserving the overall sheet-forming tendency.\n\n5. AAABBAAAABAABBBAAA:\nRationale: This sequence starts with a longer 'A' stretch and removes one 'B' from the beginning compared to our best performer. This might change how the sheet initially forms while maintaining the overall pattern that seems to favor sheet formation.\n\nThese proposals aim to balance exploitation of the successful sequence with careful exploration of nearby sequence space. In the context of polymer self-assembly:\n\n1. We maintain longer stretches of 'A' monomers, which likely contribute to the formation of the sheet core through attractive interactions.\n2. The distribution of 'B' monomers is subtly altered in each sequence to explore their role in determining sheet properties such as thickness, edge structure, and potentially curvature.\n3. We're exploring the impact of slightly longer 'A' or 'B' stretches in different positions, which might influence local structure within the sheets and overall morphology.\n4. The overall balance between attractive and repulsive interactions is preserved to promote sheet-like structures rather than other morphologies.\n\nThese sequences represent small steps in the nearby solution space of our best performer, allowing us to potentially find even better solutions while minimizing the risk of moving too far from the known good structure. We've also ensured that none of these sequences duplicate previously evaluated ones."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired morphology:\nABAAAABAAAABAABBBAAA: 4.330\nABAAAABAAAABAABABAAA: 6.412\nABAAAABAAABBAABABAAA: 7.353\nABAAAABAAABBAABABABA: 13.416\nABAAAABAAABAAABABABA: 12.154\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.

It seems our previous batch didn't perform as well as hoped. Let's refocus on our best-known solutions and make careful adjustments. Here are five new proposals:\n\n1. ABAAABBAAAABAABBBAAA:\nRationale: This is our previously best-performing sequence (distance 1.267). Given the poor performance of recent variations, it's worth re-evaluating this sequence to confirm its performance and use it as a benchmark.\n\n2. ABAAABBAAAABABBBAAAA:\nRationale: This sequence is very similar to our best performer but shifts one 'B' towards the middle and moves an 'A' to the end. This subtle change might alter the sheet's edge properties while maintaining the overall successful structure.\n\n3. ABAABBAAAABAABBBAAA:\nRationale: We've moved one 'B' towards the beginning compared to our best performer. This might create a slightly different initiation point for sheet formation while keeping the successful middle and end portions intact.\n\n4. ABAAABBAAAAABBABBAAA:\nRationale: This sequence maintains the overall structure of our best performer but adjusts the distribution of 'B' monomers in the latter half. This might influence the internal structure or curvature of the sheet while preserving the overall sheet-forming tendency.\n\n5. ABAAABBAAAABABBBAAA:\nRationale: This sequence is similar to our original good sequence (ABAAABBAAAABBABBBAAA) with a slight modification. It maintains the pattern of 'A' and 'B' clusters that seems to favor sheet formation, with a small adjustment in the middle.\n\nThese proposals aim to balance exploitation of known successful patterns with careful exploration of new variations. In the context of polymer self-assembly:\n\n1. We continue to maintain longer stretches of 'A' monomers, which likely contribute to the formation of the sheet core through attractive interactions.\n2. The distribution of 'B' monomers is subtly altered in each sequence to explore their role in determining sheet properties such as thickness, edge structure, and potentially curvature.\n3. We're exploring the impact of small changes in the position of 'B' monomers, which might influence local structure within the sheets and overall morphology.\n4. The overall balance between attractive and repulsive interactions is preserved to promote sheet-like structures rather than other morphologies.\n\nThese sequences represent a more conservative approach, staying closer to known good solutions while making small adjustments. This strategy aims to fine-tune the balance between attractive and repulsive interactions to achieve the desired sheet-like membrane morphology.
