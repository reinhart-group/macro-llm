We've found three good solutions, with the best having a distance of 0.172. Let's build upon these successes and explore further:\n\n1. AABAAABBBAAAABABBBAB\nRationale: This sequence is very similar to our best performer (0.172), with only the last 'A' changed to 'B'. It maintains the highly successful 'AABAAABBBAAAABABBB' start and explores whether ending with 'AB' instead of 'AA' can further improve membrane formation.\n\n2. AABAAABBBAAAABAABBAB\nRationale: This sequence combines elements from two top performers (0.283 and 0.172). It keeps the successful 'AABAAABBBAAAA' start and explores a slight variation in the tail region, testing if this hybrid approach can yield even better results.\n\n3. AABAAABBBAAAABABBABA\nRationale: This sequence maintains the successful 'AABAAABBBAAAA' start but introduces a different pattern in the latter half. It explores whether alternating 'A' and 'B' more frequently in the tail region can enhance sheet-like structure formation while keeping the successful head.\n\n4. AABAABBBAAAABABBBAA\nRationale: This sequence is similar to our best performer but removes one 'A' from the start. It tests whether a slight reduction in the initial hydrophilic region can improve the balance between attractive and repulsive interactions for optimal sheet formation, while maintaining the successful tail.\n\n5. AABAAABBBAAABBABBBAA\nRationale: This sequence keeps the successful start and end of our best performer but introduces a 'BB' pair in the middle. It explores whether this slight increase in local hydrophobicity in the central region can further promote sheet-like membranes while keeping the overall successful structure.\n\nThese proposals build upon the insights from the previous results, focusing on sequences similar to the top performers (especially 0.172 and 0.283) while introducing variations to explore nearby solution space.
