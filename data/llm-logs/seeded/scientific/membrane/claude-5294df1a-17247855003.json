AABAAABBAAAAABABBABA:\nWe're revisiting this sequence from a previous batch that performed exceptionally well (0.167). It's worth testing again to confirm its consistency and compare with our new variations.\n\n3. AABAAABBAAAABABBBAAA:\nThis sequence maintains the successful start and middle portions but adjusts the end slightly. We've moved one 'B' earlier and ended with three 'A's, which might affect the sheet edge formation.\n\n4. AABAABBBAAAAABABBBAA:\nWe're exploring a variation that introduces an additional 'B' earlier in the sequence. This might affect the initial formation of the sheet while keeping the core structure that has shown success.\n\n5. AABAAABBAAAAABBABAAA:\nThis sequence keeps the successful start and middle portions but introduces a new pattern at the end. This might create a different edge structure while maintaining the overall sheet-forming tendency.\n\nRationale:\n\n1. We're heavily exploiting the success of the best-performing sequences by maintaining their overall structure, particularly the \"AABAAABBA\" motif at the beginning and the long stretch of 'A's in the middle.\n\n2. We're exploring small variations in the arrangement of 'A' and 'B' monomers, focusing on modifications that maintain the overall structure but might fine-tune specific aspects of sheet formation.\n\n3. The proposed sequences aim to balance strong attractive interactions (promoting sheet formation) with controlled repulsive interactions (preventing overly thick aggregates).\n\n4. We're maintaining the pattern of having more 'A' monomers in the middle of the sequence, which seems to be crucial for achieving good results.\n\n5. These proposals consider the principles of polymer self-assembly, where even small changes in the sequence can influence the resulting morphology. We're particularly focusing on the balance between attractive and repulsive interactions at different points along the chain.\n\n6. We're avoiding long stretches of 'B' monomers, as previous results suggest this leads to poor performance.\n\nBy carefully balancing exploitation of the most successful sequences with subtle exploration, we aim to further optimize the sequences for sheet-like membrane formation. The focus is on maintaining the successful overall structure while introducing minimal changes that might improve specific aspects of the self-assembly process, such as initial formation, central cohesion, or edge properties. We're also revisiting a previously successful sequence to ensure consistency in the results and provide a benchmark for our new proposals."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired morphology:\nAABAAABBAAAABABBBAAA: 1.195\nAABAABBBAAAAABABBBAA: 3.362\nAABAAABBAAAAABBABAAA: 1.403\nAAAAAABBAAAAABABBBBA: 10.432\nAABAAABBBAAAABABBABB: 1.515\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.

We have one sequence performing well (distance less than 1.34) and two others close to the threshold. Let's use these insights to propose five new sequences:\n\n1. AABAAABBAAAABABBBAA:\nThis sequence is very similar to the best performer (1.195), with a slight modification at the end.
