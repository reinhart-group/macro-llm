It seems we've moved away from some of the previously successful patterns. Let's try to combine insights from these new results with what we've learned in earlier iterations:\n\n1. AAABBBAAABABABAABAA\nRationale: This sequence is inspired by the best performer in this batch (AAABABBAAABABABAABBA), but adjusts the distribution of 'B' monomers. We're maintaining the 'AAAB' start and 'AABAA' end, which appeared in some previous good solutions, while exploring a different middle pattern.\n\n2. AAABBBAABAAABBBAAAB\nRationale: This sequence revisits the core pattern (BBBAABAAABBB) that was successful in earlier iterations. We're combining it with the 'AAA' start that appears in the current best performer, hoping to strike a balance between previous successes and recent insights.\n\n3. AABBAAAAAABBBAABBAA\nRationale: Inspired by the second-best performer in this batch (AABBAAAAAABBBBAABBAA), this sequence maintains the 'AABBAAAAA' start and 'ABBAA' end, but adjusts the middle section. This explores whether a more compact 'BBB' cluster in the middle can improve sheet-like assembly.\n\n4. AAABABBAAABABBAABAA\nRationale: This sequence keeps the successful start and alternating pattern from the best performer but modifies the end. It explores whether ending with 'AABAA' instead of 'AABBA' can improve the sheet-like morphology.\n\n5. ABAAABBBAABAAABBAAA\nRationale: This sequence combines elements from previously successful patterns (ABAAABB...) with the grouping of 'B' monomers that seemed beneficial in some recent batches. It explores whether this combination can yield a good result by balancing attractive and repulsive interactions along the chain.\n\nThese proposals aim to balance the exploitation of patterns that have shown promise in both recent and earlier batches with exploration of new arrangements. They maintain a focus on the balance and distribution of attractive 'A' and repulsive 'B' monomers, which is crucial for self-assembly into sheet-like membranes in the Kremer-Grest model.\n\nKey features we're exploring:\n1. The impact of alternating 'A' and 'B' monomers in the middle of the sequence\n2. The effect of different distributions of 'B' monomers, including compact clusters and more spread-out arrangements\n3. The influence of 'AAA' starts and 'AABAA' or 'ABBAA' ends\n4. Revisiting previously successful core patterns while incorporating new insights\n\nBy combining these different approaches, we hope to find sequences that perform significantly better than the recent results and ideally fall below the 1.34 threshold for good solutions.
