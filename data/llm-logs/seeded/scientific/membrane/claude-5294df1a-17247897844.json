While none of the sequences achieved our target distance of less than 1.34, we can see that ABBBAABAAAAABBBBAABA performed the best with a distance of 2.342. Let's use this insight to guide our next proposals:\n\n1. ABBBAABAAAAABBBBAAAA\nRationale: This sequence is very similar to our best performer from the last batch, but we've moved the final 'B' to the beginning. This might create a more pronounced hydrophobic region at the start while maintaining the overall structure that led to better performance.\n\n2. AABBAABAAAAABBBBAABA\nRationale: We're revisiting this sequence which previously performed very well (distance 0.943). Given the recent results, it's worth testing this known good solution again to ensure consistency and use it as a benchmark.\n\n3. ABBAABBAAAAABBBBAABA\nRationale: This sequence maintains the successful latter half of our recent best performer but modifies the beginning. The 'ABBAABB' start might create an interesting folding dynamic that could influence sheet formation.\n\n4. ABBBAAABAAAABBBBAABA\nRationale: We're keeping the successful 'ABBB' start and 'BBAABA' end from our recent best performer, but introducing more alternation in the middle. This might affect the flexibility of the resulting sheet structure.\n\n5. AABBAABAAAABBBBAABAA\nRationale: This sequence performed well in a previous batch (distance 1.488). We're including it to explore its performance in the context of our recent results and to potentially identify consistent patterns.\n\nThese proposals aim to balance exploitation of recently successful patterns with careful exploration of nearby sequence space.

The influence of 'BBB' or 'BBBB' groups towards the end on sheet edge behavior.\n4.
