While we didn't find any new sequences below the 1.34 threshold, we've gained some valuable insights. Let's use this information to guide our next proposals:\n\n1. BBAABABBAAAABBBAAAAA\nReasoning: This remains our best performer with a distance of 0.278. It's crucial to include it again to confirm its performance and use it as a baseline for further modifications.\n\n2. BBAABABBBAAAABBAAAAA\nReasoning: This sequence is based on our last batch's best performer (1.397) but shifts the 'BBB' block slightly earlier. This might fine-tune the balance between hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions in the micelle core.\n\n3. BBAABABBAAABBBAAABAA\nReasoning: This proposal keeps the successful 'BBAABABB' start and 'AAABBB' middle but introduces a new 'AAABAA' end. This might influence the termination of the micelle structure while maintaining the core that has proven successful.\n\n4. BBAABAABBAAAABBBAABA\nReasoning: This sequence incorporates elements from our previous good performers. It starts with 'BBAA', includes alternating 'AB' patterns, and ends with 'AABA'. This combination might promote heterogeneity while maintaining a structure conducive to worm-like micelle formation.\n\n5. BBAABABBABAAABBAAAAA\nReasoning: This sequence maintains the successful 'BBAABABB' start but introduces a new 'ABAAABB' middle section. This might create a slight kink or curvature in the micelle structure, potentially enhancing its worm-like characteristics.\n\nThese proposals aim to balance exploitation of our best-performing sequences with exploration of new possibilities. We're focusing on:\n\n1. Maintaining the successful 'BBAABABB' or similar initiation patterns that seem crucial for the desired morphology.\n2. Fine-tuning the distribution of 'A' and 'B' blocks, especially in the middle and end sections, to optimize the balance between attractive and repulsive interactions.\n3.
