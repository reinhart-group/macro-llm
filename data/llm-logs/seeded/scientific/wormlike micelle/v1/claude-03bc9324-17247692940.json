It's exciting to see that we've found two new good solutions: BBBBAABBAAAABBBAAAAA (0.768) and BBBAABBBAAABBBBAAAAA (0.700). Let's use these insights to propose five new sequences:\n\n1. BBBAABBBAAABBBBAAABA\nReasoning: This sequence is based on our best performer (0.700) with a small modification at the end. We're exploring if changing the termination from 'AAAAA' to 'AAABA' can further improve the micelle structure while maintaining the successful core.\n\n2. BBBBAABBAAABBBBAAAAA\nReasoning: This combines elements from both new good solutions. It starts with 'BBBB' like the 0.768 solution but incorporates the 'BBBB' block in the middle like the 0.700 solution. This might create a hybrid structure that captures the best features of both.\n\n3. BBBAABBBAAAABBBBAAAA\nReasoning: We keep the successful 'BBBAABBB' start from the 0.700 solution but adjust the distribution of 'A' and 'B' monomers in the latter half. This might fine-tune the balance between attractive and repulsive interactions towards the end of the micelle.\n\n4. BBBBAABBBAAABBBAAAAA\nReasoning: This sequence starts with 'BBBB' like the 0.768 solution but then follows a pattern more similar to the 0.700 solution. We're exploring if this combination can yield an even better structure.\n\n5.
