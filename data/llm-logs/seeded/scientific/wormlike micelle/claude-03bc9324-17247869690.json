Although we didn't find any new good solutions in this batch, we can use these insights to refine our approach. Let's propose five new sequences:\n\n1. BBBAAABBAAABBBBAAAAA\nReasoning: This remains our best-performing sequence (distance 0.124 from a previous batch). We include it again to confirm its performance and use it as a baseline for comparison with new variations.\n\n2.
