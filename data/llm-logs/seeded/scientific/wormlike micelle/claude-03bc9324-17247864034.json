Based on these results, I'll propose five new sequences with explanations:\n\n1. BBBAABABAAAABBBAABAA\nRationale: This sequence is a slight modification of the best performer BBBAABABAAAABBBAAAAA (0.189). By introducing a 'B' bead near the end, we might enhance the heterogeneity of the worm-like structure while maintaining the overall successful pattern. This could potentially create a small kink in the micelle structure without disrupting the core arrangement that led to excellent results.\n\n2. BBBAAABAAAABBBAAAAA\nRationale: This sequence maintains the successful \"BBB\" start and \"BBBAAAAA\" end but explores a different arrangement in the middle. By reducing one 'B' bead and introducing a longer 'A' segment in the middle, we might influence the curvature of the worm-like micelles while still promoting the formation of the desired morphology.\n\n3. BBBAABABABAABBBAAAAA\nRationale: Building on the success of the \"BBBAABABA\" pattern at the start of the best performer, this sequence explores a slightly different distribution of 'A' and 'B' beads in the middle. The alternating pattern might promote heterogeneity in the micelle structure.\n\n4. BBBABABAAAABBBAAAAAA\nRationale: This sequence combines elements from the successful BBBAABABAAAABBBAAAAA (0.189) but adjusts the latter part. By increasing the number of consecutive 'A' beads at the end, we might create a different tail structure in the micelles, potentially affecting their overall morphology.\n\n5. BBBAABABAAABBBBAAAAA\nRationale: This proposal keeps the successful start of BBBAABABAAAABBBAAAAA but introduces an additional 'B' bead in the middle. This slight change might create a more pronounced hydrophobic region, potentially influencing the curvature and heterogeneity of the worm-like structures.\n\nThese proposals aim to refine our understanding of what makes a successful sequence for forming heterogeneous, worm-like micelle aggregates. We're focusing on sequences that have shown promise (particularly those with distances below 1.34) while making small adjustments to explore nearby solution space.\n\nKey considerations in these proposals:\n\n1. The importance of starting with three 'B' beads, which has consistently contributed to good results.\n2. The balance between 'A' and 'B' clusters throughout the sequence, affecting the hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions of the forming micelles.\n3.
