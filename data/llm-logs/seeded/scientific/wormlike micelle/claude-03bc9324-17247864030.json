It's exciting to see that we've discovered two more good solutions. Let's use these insights to propose five new sequences:\n\n1. BABAABBAAAAABBBAABAA\nReasoning: This sequence is based on the best performer (BABAABBAAAAABBBAAAAA) but introduces a small change at the end ('AABAA' instead of 'AAAAA'). This might maintain the successful overall structure while potentially introducing a bit more heterogeneity at the micelle's end.\n\n2. BBBBAABBAAAAABBBAAAA\nReasoning: This sequence combines elements from two good solutions (BBBBAABBAAAABBBAAAAA and BABAABBAAAAABBBAAAAA). It keeps the 'BBBB' start from one and the 'AAAAA' middle section from the other, which might create an interesting balance of hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions.\n\n3. BABBAABBAAAAABBBAAAA\nReasoning: This sequence is inspired by the best performer but introduces an additional 'B' early in the sequence. This might affect the initiation of the micelle formation while keeping the successful middle and end sections.\n\n4. BBBAAABBAAAAABBBAAAA\nReasoning: This sequence maintains the 'BBB' start that has been successful in previous iterations, followed by the pattern from the best performer. This arrangement might provide a strong hydrophobic core while maintaining the flexibility in the middle section.\n\n5. BABAABBAAAABBBBAAAAA\nReasoning: This sequence keeps the successful 'BABA' start from the best performer but rearranges the 'B' monomers to create a 'BBBB' block near the end. This might influence the curvature of the worm-like structure while maintaining the overall successful pattern.\n\nThese proposals aim to refine our approach based on the newly discovered good solutions and our accumulated knowledge. We're focusing on:\n\n1. Exploring variations of the 'BABA' and 'BBBB' starts, which appear to be crucial elements in forming the desired micelle structure.\n2. Maintaining the longer stretch of 'AAAAA' in the middle, which seems to contribute to the success of the sequences.\n3. Investigating the effects of rearranging 'B' monomers, particularly creating longer 'B' blocks in different positions.\n4. Fine-tuning the sequence ends, which could impact the termination of the micelle formation.\n\nWe're trying to balance the exploitation of successful elements from the good solutions with exploration of new arrangements that might yield additional good solutions.
