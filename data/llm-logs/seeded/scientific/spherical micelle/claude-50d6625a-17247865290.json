We've made excellent progress, with two sequences achieving distances less than 1.34: AAAAAAAABAABBABAABAB (1.004) and AAAAAAABAABABBAABABB (1.131). Let's use these insights to propose five new sequences that might yield structures even closer to the target of uniform spherical micelles or explore nearby solution space.\n\n1. AAAAAAAABAABBABAABBA:\nRationale: This sequence is very similar to our best performer (1.004), with the last 'B' moved to the end. This subtle change might further improve the micelle surface properties and uniformity by altering the polymer end behavior.\n\n2. AAAAAAAABBAABBABAABA:\nRationale: Based on the success of the first sequence, this proposal introduces an additional 'B' earlier in the sequence while maintaining the overall pattern. This might create a slightly stronger hydrophobic core while preserving the beneficial surface characteristics.\n\n3. AAAAAAABAABABBAABBAB:\nRationale: This sequence is a variation of our second-best performer (1.131), with the last two beads swapped. This minor adjustment might fine-tune the balance between core formation and surface properties.\n\n4. AAAAAAAABAABABBAABAB:\nRationale: Combining elements from both successful sequences, this proposal explores whether increasing the initial 'A' block by one while maintaining the middle and end sections of the second-best performer can further improve performance.\n\n5. AAAAAAAABABBABAABABA:\nRationale: This sequence maintains the successful initial 'A' block but explores a slightly different distribution of 'B' beads in the middle and end sections. This might affect the overall polymer conformation and potentially improve micelle packing or size distribution.\n\nThese proposals aim to fine-tune the two best-performing sequences from the previous batch while also exploring slight variations that could potentially yield even better results.
