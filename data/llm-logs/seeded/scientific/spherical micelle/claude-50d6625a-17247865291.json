While we haven't found any new solutions below the 1.34 threshold, we have some promising sequences to build upon. Let's propose five new sequences based on these insights:\n\n1. BBABBBBABAABAAAAAAAA\nRationale: This remains our best-performing sequence (distance 0.257 from a previous iteration). It's important to include it again to confirm its consistent performance and use it as a baseline for further optimization.\n\n2. ABBBABBBABAABAAAAAAB\nRationale: This is a modification of the best sequence from the last batch (ABBBABBBABAABAAAAAAA, distance 1.633). We've moved one 'B' to the end to explore if a terminal hydrophobic bead can improve micelle stability without disrupting the overall structure.\n\n3. BBABBBBABAABAAAAAABA\nRationale: This sequence is very similar to our best performer but with a slight modification in the tail. It tests whether a small change in the distribution of 'A' beads at the end can further optimize micelle formation.\n\n4. ABBBABBBABAABAAAAABA\nRationale: This sequence combines elements from the two best performers we've seen (starting with 'A' and including the 'BAAB' pattern). It explores whether this combination can yield even better results, with a slight modification in the tail.\n\n5. BBBABBBABAABAAAAAAAA\nRationale: This sequence is similar to our best performer but starts with an additional 'B'. It investigates whether a slightly longer hydrophobic head region can enhance micelle formation while maintaining the successful 'BAAB' pattern.\n\nThese sequences aim to:\n\n1. Confirm the performance of our best-known solution.\n2. Explore the effect of a terminal hydrophobic bead on micelle stability.\n3. Fine-tune the distribution of hydrophilic beads in the tail region.\n4. Combine successful elements from different high-performing sequences.\n5.
