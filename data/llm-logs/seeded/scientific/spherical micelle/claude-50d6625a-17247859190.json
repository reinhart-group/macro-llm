We're still not reaching the target of less than 1.34, but we can use these insights to guide our next proposals. Let's try some new approaches while keeping in mind the patterns that have shown some promise:\n\n1. BBBBBBBAAAAAABAAAABA:\nRationale: This sequence adds one more 'B' to the initial segment compared to previous good performers. A longer hydrophobic segment might create a more stable micelle shell, while maintaining the 'AAAAAABAAAABA' pattern that has shown some promise.\n\n2. BBBBBBAAAAAAABAAABA:\nRationale: This sequence is similar to some of the better-performing ones, but with a slight rearrangement of the 'A' and 'B' beads at the end. This might create a more optimal balance between the hydrophobic shell and the hydrophilic core.\n\n3. BBBBBBAAAAAAABAABAA:\nRationale: This sequence maintains the initial 'BBBBBB' segment that has been common in better-performing sequences, but explores a different arrangement of 'A' and 'B' beads in the latter part. The 'BAABAA' ending might influence the micelle surface curvature.\n\n4. BBBBBBAAAAAABABAAAA:\nRationale: This sequence keeps the initial 'BBBBBB' segment but introduces a 'BABAAAA' motif at the end. This might create a more complex interface between the hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions, potentially leading to better packing and more uniform spherical structures.\n\n5. BBBBBBAAAAABAAAAAAB:\nRationale: This sequence explores a different distribution of 'B' beads within the predominantly 'A' region. By placing a 'B' bead at the very end, we might create a small anchor that could influence the overall micelle shape and stability.\n\nThese proposals continue to focus on the successful elements we've seen so far, particularly the initial 'BBBBBB' segment and a large continuous 'A' segment.
