It's encouraging to see that BBBABABABABABAAAAAAA performed well. Let's use these insights to propose five new sequences:\n\n1. BBBABABABABABAAAAAAAA\nRationale: This sequence is very similar to the best performer (BBBABABABABABAAAAAAA, 1.259) but moves one 'A' from the alternating section to the end. This slight modification might further improve micelle formation by providing a longer continuous hydrophilic tail while maintaining the effective core structure.\n\n2. BBBBABABABABABAAAAAA\nRationale: This sequence adds one 'B' to the initial block compared to the best performer. It explores whether a slightly larger hydrophobic core can lead to even more uniform spherical micelles while keeping the successful alternating pattern.\n\n3. BBBABABABABAAAAAAAAAA\nRationale: This arrangement reduces the alternating 'ABABA' pattern by one pair compared to the best performer and extends the hydrophilic tail. It investigates whether a longer hydrophilic section can improve micelle stability and uniformity.\n\n4. BBBABABABAABAAAAAAAA\nRationale: This sequence maintains the initial 'BBB' block from the best performer but introduces a small 'AA' section earlier in the alternating pattern. It explores whether this arrangement can provide an optimal balance between core structure and surface properties for spherical micelle formation.\n\n5. BBABABABABABAAAAAAAA\nRationale: This sequence slightly reduces the initial hydrophobic block compared to the best performer but maintains the extended alternating pattern.
