BBBBBBBBAAAAAAAAAABA\nReasoning: This sequence is very similar to the best-performing one (BBBBBBBBAAAAAAAAAAAA), with a slight modification at the end. By moving one 'A' bead to the end, we can explore if a small change affects the micelle formation while maintaining the overall structure of grouped 'B' and 'A' beads.\n\n2. BBBBBBBAAAAAAAAAAAAB\nReasoning: This sequence also closely resembles the best performer but distributes the 'B' beads more evenly at the ends. This might help create a more uniform spherical micelle by balancing the repulsive forces at both ends of the polymer.\n\n3. BBBBBAAAAAAAAAAABBBB\nReasoning: This sequence groups the attractive 'A' beads in the middle, surrounded by repulsive 'B' beads at both ends. This arrangement might promote the formation of spherical micelles by creating a hydrophobic core and a hydrophilic shell.\n\n4.

It explores whether a more distributed arrangement of repulsive beads can still lead to good micelle formation. This sequence is quite different from the others, allowing us to explore a new region of the solution space.\n\nThese sequences balance exploitation of the known good solution (BBBBBBBBAAAAAAAAAAAA) with exploration of new patterns.

Based on these insights, I'll propose five new sequences:\n\n1. BBBABABAABAAAAAAAAA\nRationale: This sequence is based on the best performer (0.720) but removes one 'A' from the end. This slight modification might further optimize the structure by creating a more compact hydrophilic tail while maintaining the successful hydrophobic core pattern.\n\n2. BBBABABAABAAAAAAABA\nRationale: Inspired by the best performer, this sequence keeps the successful core structure but moves one 'A' bead towards the end. This arrangement might create an even more optimal balance between hydrophobic core formation and hydrophilic shell flexibility.\n\n3. BBAABABABAAAAAAAAAA\nRationale: This sequence is based on the second-best performer (0.885) but removes one 'B' from the start. This adjustment might create a slightly less rigid hydrophobic core, potentially improving micelle uniformity while still leveraging the successful pattern.\n\n4.
