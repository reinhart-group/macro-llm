It's great to see that we have two more good solutions, with BBBABABABABABAAAAAAA and BBBBABBABABBAAAAAAAA performing well. Let's build upon these insights to propose five new sequences:\n\n1. BBBBABABABABABAAAAAA\nReasoning: This sequence combines elements from our two best performers, maintaining a strong initial hydrophobic block followed by an extended alternating 'AB' pattern. It explores whether this balance might further optimize micelle formation and stability.\n\n2.
