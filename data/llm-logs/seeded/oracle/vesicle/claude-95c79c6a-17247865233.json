BABBBAABAAAABAABAABA: 0.000 (Known good solution)\nThis sequence has the lowest distance, so we'll use it as a base for some variations.\n\n2. BABBBAABAAAABAABABAA\nReasoning: This sequence maintains the overall structure of the best solution but swaps the positions of two 'A's and two 'B's near the end.
