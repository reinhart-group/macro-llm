They all maintain the required 12 'A's and 8 'B's and avoid exact duplicates of sequences evaluated in the immediately previous batch.\n\nThe focus of this batch is on:\n1. Revisiting our two best-performing sequences (0.000 and 0.300) to confirm their performance and use them as benchmarks.\n2. Exploring variations of these top performers and recent relatively good performers, particularly focusing on alterations in the latter part of the sequence.\n3. Combining elements from successful sequences to potentially find new good solutions.\n\nThis strategy balances exploitation of known good solutions with a degree of exploration, aiming to either find an even better solution or to solidify our understanding of what makes the current best solutions effective. We're particularly interested in seeing if small changes to our best solutions or combinations of successful elements can yield even better results, while also keeping an eye on the patterns that have consistently performed well across multiple iterations."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nBABBAABBAAAABAABAAAA: 9.675\nBBBBBAABAAAABAABAABA: 0.739\nBABBABABAAAABAABAABA: 0.891\nBAABBAAAAAAABABBAAAA: 12.378\nBBABBAABAAAABAABBBBA: 5.496\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
