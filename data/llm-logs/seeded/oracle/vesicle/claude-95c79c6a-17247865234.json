BABBBAABAAAABAABAABA: 0.000 (Known good result)\nThis sequence has already been identified as giving a good result, so I'll use it as a base for some variations.\n\n2. BABBBAABAAAABAABABAA\nReasoning: This sequence is very similar to the known good result, with just a small change at the end.

We're particularly interested in fine-tuning the exact positioning of 'B's throughout the sequence, as this seems to be the key to finding optimal solutions.\n\nWe continue to avoid duplicates and previously evaluated sequences, balancing exploitation of our near-miss solutions with exploration of closely related sequences. Given our proximity to the target, these proposals lean more towards exploitation, aiming to find that slight adjustment that pushes us below the 1.34 threshold."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nBAABAABAAAAABABAABAA: 2.966\nBAABAABAAAABABAAABAA: 0.688\nBAABAABAAAABAABAAABA: 2.383\nBAABAABAAAABAABAABAA: 0.740\nBAABAABAABAAABAAABAA: 7.081\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
