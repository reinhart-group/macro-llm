ABAAABBAAAABBABBBABA\nReasoning: This sequence is very similar to the known good result (ABAAABBAAAABBABBBAAA), with only a small change at the end. By swapping the last two characters, we can explore if slight variations in the tail end of the sequence affect the distance significantly.\n\n2.

Exploring variations in the distribution of 'A's and 'B's, especially at the start and end of the sequence.\n4. Maintaining the consistent 'AAAAABB' pattern in the middle, which has been present in many good solutions.\n\nWe're continuing to refine our approach based on the patterns that have yielded good results so far. As we move forward, we'll adjust our strategy based on the outcomes of these sequences, potentially exploring more diverse patterns if these don't yield further improvements."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nABAAAABAAAAABBAABBAA: 4.169\nABAAAABBAAAABBAABBAA: 1.834\nABAAAABBAABABBAABBAA: 8.090\nABBAAABBAABABBAABBAA: 11.206\nABBAAABBAABABBAAABAA: 5.786\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.

Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
