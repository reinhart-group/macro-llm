It maintains the overall structure while potentially improving the distance by adjusting the A/B balance at the beginning.\n\n4. ABAABBAAAAABBABBAAA:\nRationale: This sequence is very similar to our previous best performer but moves one 'B' earlier in the sequence. It tests if a slight rearrangement of the 'B's can yield an even better result.\n\n5. ABAAABBAAAAABABBBAAA:\nRationale: This keeps the successful start of our previous best performer but changes the arrangement of 'B's in the latter half. It tests if a different distribution of 'B's towards the end can further optimize the result.\n\nThese proposals aim to bridge the gap between our earlier successful results and the recent explorations. They maintain the required 12 'A's and 8 'B's and avoid duplicating previously evaluated sequences. The strategy combines:\n\n1. Re-evaluation of our previous best solution (proposal 1)\n2. Refinement of our previous best solution (proposals 2 and 4)\n3. Improvement on the recent best performer (proposal 3)\n4. Exploration of new 'B' distributions while keeping successful starting patterns (proposal 5)\n\nThis approach should help us reorient towards the target while still allowing for potential new discoveries. By including our previous best solution and making small variations to it, we ensure we don't lose sight of what has worked well in the past, while still exploring new possibilities."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nABAAABBAAAAAABBABBAA: 2.629\nABAAABBAAAAABABBBAAA: 0.877\nABAAABBAAABBBBABBAAA: 3.915\nABAAABBAAABAABABBAAA: 2.939\nABAAABBAAABAABBABBAA: 5.579\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
