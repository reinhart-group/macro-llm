It explores whether a small change in the distribution can further improve the result.\n\n5. ABABABBBAAABAABBAAA:\nRationale: This sequence maintains the successful \"ABABABBB\" prefix from the recent good solution but incorporates elements from other good solutions we've seen, particularly in the latter half.\n\nThese proposals aim to exploit the patterns observed in the good solutions while also exploring nearby variations. They maintain the required 12 'A's and 8 'B's and avoid duplicating previously evaluated sequences.\n\nThe strategy here is to:\n1. Explore minor variations of the recent good solution (1.179), focusing on:\n   a. The impact of the final 'A'.\n   b. The importance of the alternating 'AB' pattern at the start.\n   c. The distribution of 'A's and 'B's in the middle of the sequence.\n2. Keep the overall best known solution in our set for comparison.\n3. Combine elements from different good solutions to potentially find an even better sequence.\n\nThis approach balances exploitation of the newly found good solution with exploration of its immediate neighborhood in the solution space. By making small, targeted changes to the good solution and combining successful elements from various solutions, we aim to understand what makes these sequences effective and potentially find even better solutions."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nABABABAAAAABAAABBAAA: 0.950\nABAAABBAAABBBABBBAAA: 3.823\nABABABAAAAABAAABBABA: 4.456\nABAAABBAAABBAABBBAAA: 2.526\nABABABAAAAABAAABAABA: 7.100\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
