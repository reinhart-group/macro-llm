We're particularly focusing on:\n1. The arrangement of 'A's and 'B's in the middle section of the sequence, especially exploring longer 'A' clusters.\n2. The ending pattern, which seems to be crucial for good results.\n3. Maintaining the successful 'AAABBA' start that appears in many of our better solutions.\n\nOur goal is to find an optimal arrangement that might be just a character or two away from our current best result, while also allowing for the possibility that a slightly different pattern could yield even better results. We're getting close to the end of our iterations, so we're trying to hone in on the most promising patterns we've discovered so far."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nAAABBABAAAAABAAABABB: 3.741\nAAABBABAAAAABAAABBAA: 1.064\nAAABBABAAAABAAAABAAB: 3.539\nAAABBABABBAABAAABAAB: 2.987\nAAABBABABAABBAAABABA: 6.434\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.

Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
