It explores whether a different distribution of 'B's in the first half can lead to a better result.\n\n5. ABAAABBAAAABBABBBAAA:\nReasoning: This is our original best solution (0.000). We're including it again to ensure we don't miss out on the optimal sequence and to use as a benchmark.\n\nThese proposals balance exploitation of our known good solutions (0.000 and 0.428) and the recent better-performing sequence (1.998) with exploration of nearby sequence space. We're focusing on fine-tuning the arrangement of 'A's and 'B's, particularly in the latter half of the sequence and slightly in the first half. This approach should help us further refine our understanding of what leads to optimal solutions and potentially discover even better sequences or confirm the optimality of our current best solutions. By including our top performers from different iterations, we can also assess their consistency across multiple evaluations."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nABAAABBAABABBABABAAA: 7.124\nABAAABBAAAABBBBBBAAA: 1.730\nABAAABAAABABBABABAAA: 8.340\nABAAABBAAAABBBBBBABA: 8.280\nAAAAABAAABABBABABAAA: 9.577\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
