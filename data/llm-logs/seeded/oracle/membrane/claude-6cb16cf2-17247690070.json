Comparing our new best performer with the previous best to ensure consistency.\n\nThis approach balances exploitation of our current best solution with continued exploration of the solution space to ensure we're not missing any potential improvements. We're honing in on what seems to be a very promising area of the solution space while still allowing for some variation to avoid getting stuck in a local optimum."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nAABABABBAAAAABBBABBA: 4.720\nBABAAABBAAAAABBABBBA: 4.730\nAABABAABAAAAABBBABBA: 1.286\nBABAAABBAABAABBABBBA: 14.986\nAABBBAABAAAAABBBABBA: 4.231\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions. Please propose five new 20-character sequences (12 'A', 8 'B') that build upon the insights from these results to yield distances closer to the target. Remember to: 1. Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
