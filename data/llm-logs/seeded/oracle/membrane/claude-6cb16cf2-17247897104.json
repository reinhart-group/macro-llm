They all maintain the required 12 'A's and 8 'B's and avoid duplicating previously evaluated sequences. The focus is on refining our best-known solutions by making small adjustments, particularly around the arrangement of 'B's in the latter part of the sequence. This approach balances exploitation of our current best results with continued exploration of the solution space, aiming to find sequences that can match or beat our current best distance of 0.566."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nAAAAABBAAAABBAABBAAA: 8.411\nAAAAABBAAAABBAABBABA: 8.826\nAABAABBAAAABBAABBABA: 3.022\nAABABBBAAAABBAABBABA: 2.824\nAABABBBAAAABBAAABABA: 2.609\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
