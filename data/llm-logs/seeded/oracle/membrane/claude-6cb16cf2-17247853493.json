Exploit the pattern of our new best solution (0.566) by making small variations.\n2. Reconfirm our previous best solution from earlier iterations.\n3. Explore different arrangements of 'A's and 'B's, particularly in the latter half of the sequence.\n4. Balance between exploiting known good solutions and exploring new possibilities.\n\nWe're focusing on sequences that are very similar to our new best solution while also keeping in mind our previously successful patterns. By making subtle modifications to these sequences, we hope to find a combination that yields an even lower distance.\n\nAs we continue, we'll keep refining our approach based on these outcomes. We're getting closer to finding optimal solutions, so our strategy now is to make very small, targeted changes to our best-known sequences to see if we can squeeze out any further improvements."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nABAAAABAAAABBAABBAAA: 3.988\nABAAABBAAAABBBBBBAAA: 1.730\nABAAAABAABABBAABBAAA: 7.293\nABBAABBAAAABBABBBAAA: 4.672\nABAAAABAABBBBAABBAAA: 10.219\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
