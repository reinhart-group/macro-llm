It explores whether a different arrangement of 'B's at the beginning can lead to improvements.\n\nThese proposals continue to exploit the successful patterns we've observed (having a cluster of 'B's early in the sequence, a run of 'A's in the middle, and often ending with 'BABABA' or similar) while still exploring variations. They all maintain the required 12A/8B ratio and avoid duplicating previous sequences.\n\nThe focus remains on fine-tuning the sequence that has shown the best result so far, while also testing the importance of specific parts of the sequence. We're exploring whether slight modifications to the established patterns might lead to improvements, particularly in the distribution of 'B's at the beginning, the length and position of the consecutive 'A' run in the middle, and the exact arrangement of the ending sequence."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nBABABBBAAAAABBABBAAA: 0.426\nBABABBBAAAAABBBABABA: 3.914\nBABABBBAAAABBBABABAA: 3.394\nBABABBABAAAABBABABAA: 2.240\nBBABBBBAAAAABBABABAA: 0.954\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
