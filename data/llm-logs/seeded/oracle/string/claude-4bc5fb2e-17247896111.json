It tests whether extending the 'A' cluster to five and rearranging the ending can produce an even better result.\n\nThese proposals aim to exploit our newly found good solutions while still allowing for some exploration. We're maintaining the elements that have proven successful (like the 'BABBBABAAAAA' pattern in our new best solution) while introducing strategic changes to explore nearby areas of the solution space.\n\nBy including our two new best solutions, we ensure we don't overlook them and can compare their performance to new variations. The other three proposals explore different combinations and distributions of 'A' and 'B' characters, particularly focusing on small variations of our best-performing sequences.\n\nAs this is our final batch, we're making very targeted changes to our most promising sequences, hoping to find subtle improvements that could push us even closer to the optimal solution or provide final insights into the nature of good solutions for this problem."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nBABBBABAAAAABABABBAB: 7.532\nBABBBABAAAAABABBABAA: 0.640\nBABBBABAAAAAABBABBAA: 2.411\nBABBBABABAAABABABBAA: 10.162\nBABBBABAAAAABABABBBA: 5.483\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
