We've found two new good solutions with distances of 0.496 and 0.645. Let's use these insights to propose five new sequences:\n\n1. ABBABABAAAAABABBABAA\nRationale: This remains our best-known solution (0.001). We'll keep it in the mix as a benchmark and to confirm its consistent performance.\n\n2. ABBABABAAAAABBABABAA\nRationale: This is our new best solution (0.496) from the last batch. We'll propose it again to ensure its performance is consistent and use it as a baseline for variations.\n\n3. BBBABABAAAAABBABABAA\nRationale: This sequence combines the promising \"BBB\" start from the good solution (0.645) with the end of our new best solution (0.496). It explores whether this hybrid approach can produce even better results.\n\n4. ABBABABAAAAABABBABBA\nRationale: This sequence is very similar to our original best solution (0.001), but with a slight modification at the very end. It tests whether this small change can improve the result further.\n\n5. BABABABAAAAABBABABBA\nRationale: This sequence starts with \"BABABAB\", which has been consistently good, and combines elements from our best solutions. It explores a slight variation in the end pattern.\n\nThese proposals balance exploitation of our known good solutions (especially sequences 1, 2, 3, and 4) with exploration of new patterns (particularly sequences 4 and 5). They avoid duplicating previous sequences while building upon the insights gained from all previous batches.\n\nKey observations:\n\n1. The \"ABBABAB\" start continues to be associated with our best solutions, but \"BBBABAB\" also shows promise.\n2. A cluster of 5 'A's in the middle seems to be consistently beneficial.\n3. The arrangement of 'B's near the end is crucial, with \"BABAB\" and \"ABABA\" patterns yielding good results.\n4. Sequences starting with \"AAB\" or containing \"BAAB\" in the middle performed poorly, suggesting these patterns should be avoided.\n\nWe're focusing on maintaining these successful elements while making small, strategic changes to explore the nearby solution space. This approach allows us to refine our understanding of what contributes to a good solution while still leaving room for potential improvements. \n\nThe poor performance of sequences with \"AAB\" at the start or \"BAAB\" in the middle reinforces the importance of maintaining a consistent pattern in these sections, which is reflected in our proposals. We're also exploring slight variations in the end pattern to see if we can further improve our best results."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nBBBABABAAAAABBABABAA: 0.551\nABBABABAAAAABABBABBA: 4.903\nBABABABAAAAABBABABBA: 4.522\nABBABABAAAAABAAAABAA: 9.481\nABBABABBAAAABBABABAA: 4.318\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
