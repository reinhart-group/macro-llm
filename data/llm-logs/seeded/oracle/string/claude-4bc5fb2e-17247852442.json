It seems we've moved slightly away from our previous best results. Let's refocus our efforts based on these new insights and our previous successful sequences. Here are five new proposals:\n\n1. AAABABABAAAAAABBBABA\nRationale: This is a return to our previously best-performing sequence (distance 0.928). Given that none of our recent variations improved upon it, it's worth re-evaluating this sequence.\n\n2. AAABABABAAAAABBBABAA\nRationale: This is a slight modification of our previous best sequence, moving one 'A' from the middle cluster to the end. It explores whether a small redistribution of 'A's can yield improvement.\n\n3. AAABABABAAAAAABBABBA\nRationale: This keeps the successful start and middle of our best sequence but rearranges the ending. It tests whether a different arrangement of 'B's at the end can be beneficial.\n\n4. AABABABAAAAAAABBBABA\nRationale: This modifies the start of our best previous sequence, changing 'AAA' to 'AA' at the beginning and adding an extra 'A' to the middle cluster. It explores whether this redistribution can produce a better result.\n\n5. AAABABAAAAAABABBBABA\nRationale: This sequence maintains the 'AAA' start and 'BBBABA' end of our best sequence but modifies the middle section. It tests whether reducing the number of alternating 'AB' pairs in the first half can be advantageous.\n\nChain-of-thought reasoning:\na. We're returning focus to sequences starting with \"AAA\" as they have consistently led to our best solutions.\nb. The middle section with five or six consecutive 'A's appears crucial, so we're maintaining this in all proposals.\nc. The ending \"BABA\" or \"ABBA\" seems important, but we're still exploring slight variations.\nd. We're making smaller, more targeted changes to our best-known solution to fine-tune our search.\ne. While focusing on refining our best solution, we've included some variations (like the fourth and fifth proposals) to ensure we're not stuck in a local minimum.\n\nThis strategy aims to recalibrate our search around our previously best-known solution while still allowing for some exploration. By making more conservative changes, we hope to find subtle improvements that can push us below the 1.34 threshold consistently."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nAAABABABAAAAABBBABAA: 1.866\nAAABABABAAAAAABBABBA: 1.230\nAABABABAAAAAAABBBABA: 2.291\nAAABABAAAAAABABBBABA: 4.695\nAAABABAAAAAAAABBBABA: 6.349\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
