Maintaining successful elements (start or middle) from the good solution while exploring variations in other parts.\n3. Testing different distributions of 'A's and 'B's while keeping the overall structure similar to successful sequences.\n4. Introducing slight variations to the start pattern to avoid getting stuck in local optima.\n\nThis approach focuses on refining our search around the newly discovered good solution while still allowing for some exploration of the solution space. We're particularly interested in seeing how small changes to this good solution affect the distance metric, as well as testing whether we can find other good solutions with similar patterns but different distributions of 'A's and 'B's at the start or end of the sequence."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nABBBABAAAAAABABBAABA: 2.619\nABBBABAAAAAABABBABBA: 5.733\nABBBABAAAAABABABBABA: 5.049\nBABBABAAAAAABABBABAA: 1.546\nABBBABAABAAABABBABAA: 9.774\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
