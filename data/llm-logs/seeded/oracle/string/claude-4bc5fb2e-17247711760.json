ABBABABAAAABABABBABA\nReasoning: This sequence maintains the overall structure of the best-known result but shifts some 'A' and 'B' characters slightly to explore nearby solutions.\n\n3.

ABABBBABAAAAABABBABA\nRationale: This explores a slight variation in the start of the successful sequence from the previous batch, changing the first \"AA\" to \"AB\".\n\nChain-of-thought reasoning:\na. The \"AAABBBABAAAA\" pattern led to a good result in the last batch, so we're focusing on variations of this pattern in most proposals.\nb. We're also reintroducing the \"AABBABAB\" start that has been successful in earlier iterations to ensure we're not overlooking good solutions.\nc. The ending sequences \"BABA\", \"BAAA\", and \"BABB\" have shown promise, so we're exploring these in our proposals.\nd. While focusing on refining the best-known patterns, we're also including some variations (like in the second and fifth proposals) to avoid getting stuck in a local optimum.\n\nThese proposals aim to further refine our understanding of what makes a good sequence by making targeted changes to successful patterns, particularly the new good solution from the last batch. We're also still including some exploration to ensure we're covering a broad solution space. The strategy will be adjusted in future iterations based on the results of these sequences."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nAAABBBABAAAAABABBAAA: 1.800\nAAABBBABABAAABABBABA: 4.888\nAAABBBABAAAAABABBABB: 0.349\nABABBBABAAAAABABBABA: 4.588\nAABBABABAAAAABABBBBA: 0.453\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.

Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
