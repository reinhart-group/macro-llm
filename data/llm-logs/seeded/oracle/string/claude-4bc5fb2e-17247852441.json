It tests whether a more balanced distribution can yield good results.\n\n5. BBBABABABAAABABBABAA\nRationale: This sequence combines elements from our recent best performer and previous good solutions. It keeps the 'BBB' start and 'BABBABAA' end, but modifies the middle part slightly. It aims to find an optimal combination of these elements.\n\nThese proposals focus on:\n1. Continuing to use the successful 'BBB' start that has shown consistent promise.\n2. Exploring different arrangements and lengths of 'A' clusters in the middle of the sequence.\n3. Testing various distributions of 'A's and 'B's, particularly in the middle part of the sequence.\n4. Maintaining the ending 'BABBABAA' or slight variations of it, which has appeared in many good solutions.\n5. Balancing exploitation of our recent insights with exploration of new patterns.\n\nBy making these targeted variations, we aim to either find a solution that breaks the 1.34 threshold or gain more precise insights into what makes a sequence perform well. This strategy allows us to continue refining our understanding of the problem while still leaving room for potential discoveries, especially considering the improvement we saw with the 'BBBAABA' pattern in the last batch."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nBBBAABABAAAABABBAABA: 6.949\nBBBAABABAAAAABABBABA: 4.074\nBBBAABAABAAABABBABAA: 7.349\nBBBAABABABAABABBABAA: 15.024\nBABAABABAAAABABBABAA: 2.354\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions. Please propose five new 20-character sequences (12 'A', 8 'B') that build upon the insights from these results to yield distances closer to the target. Remember to: 1. Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
