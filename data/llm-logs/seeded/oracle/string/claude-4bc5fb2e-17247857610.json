Based on these results, I'll propose five new sequences that aim to further optimize the distance while maintaining a balance between exploitation and exploration.\n\n1. AABBABABAAAAABBABABB\nRationale: This builds on the success of the previous batch's best result (0.811), but changes the last character to 'B' to see if it can improve the result further.\n\n2. AABBABABAAAAABBABABB\nRationale: Another variation on the best result from the previous batch, this time changing the last two characters to 'BB' to test a slightly different ending pattern.\n\n3. AABBABABAAAAABBABAAA\nRationale: This keeps the successful \"AABBABA\" start and \"ABBABA\" ending from the best previous result, but introduces a slight variation at the very end.\n\n4. AABBABAABAAAABBABABA\nRationale: This maintains the successful start and end from the best result, but introduces a slight variation in the middle to explore its effect.\n\n5. BABBABABAAAAABBABABA\nRationale: This explores starting with 'B' while maintaining the core \"ABABAAAAABBABA\" pattern that has been successful in the last batch's best result.\n\nChain-of-thought reasoning:\na. The \"AABBABA\" start continues to be effective in the last batch's best result, so we're exploring more sequences with this start.\nb. The central \"AAAAA\" sequence remains crucial in good solutions and is preserved in all proposals.\nc. The \"BBABA\" pattern at the end has shown to be successful in the last batch, so we're maintaining this in most proposals with slight variations.\nd. While focusing on refining the best-performing sequence, we're also introducing some variations (like different endings and the 'B' start in the last proposal) to continue exploring the solution space and avoid getting stuck in a local optimum.\n\nThese proposals aim to further refine our understanding of what makes a good sequence while still maintaining some level of exploration. We're putting more emphasis on exploitation of the best-known solution (starting with \"AABBABA\", central \"AAAAA\", and ending with \"BBABA\" or variations), while still introducing some novel elements. The strategy will be adjusted in future iterations based on the results of these sequences."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nAABBABABAAAAABBABABB: 1.007\nAABBABABAAAAABBABAAA: 0.988\nAABBABAABAAAABBABABA: 5.950\nBABBABABAAAAABBABABA: 3.912\nAABBABAAAAAAABBABABB: 6.092\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
