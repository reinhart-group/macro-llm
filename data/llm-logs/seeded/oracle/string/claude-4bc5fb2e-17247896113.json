ABBABABAAAAABABBABAA: 0.001 (Known good result)\nThis sequence has an extremely low distance, so I'll use it as a base for some variations.\n\n2. ABBABABAAAABABABBABA\nReasoning: This is a slight variation of the known good result, shifting the last two characters and adjusting the middle section to maintain the 12A/8B ratio.

We're particularly interested in:\n\n1. The importance of the 'ABBB' start\n2. The position of the 'AAAA' block\n3. The exact arrangement of the ending sequence\n\nBy exploring these aspects, we hope to either find an even better solution or confirm the robustness of our current best sequence. The strategy is to make small, targeted changes to the most successful sequence we've seen so far, while also testing some slightly more divergent patterns."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nABBBABBAAAAABABBABBA: 5.316\nABBBABBAAAAABABBAABA: 3.916\nABBBABAAAAABABBABABA: 4.967\nBABBABBAAAAABABBABAA: 0.546\nABBBABBAAAAABABABBAA: 0.323\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions. Please propose five new 20-character sequences (12 'A', 8 'B') that build upon the insights from these results to yield distances closer to the target. Remember to: 1. Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
