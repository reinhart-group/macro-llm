AABABABAAAAAABABBBAA\nRationale: This keeps the successful start and central pattern of our best result, but explores a different ending combination.\n\n4. AABABABABAAAABABBABA\nRationale: This sequence maintains the successful \"AABABA\" start and \"BABA\" ending, but introduces a variation in the middle to test its impact.\n\n5. AAABABAABAAAAABABBBA\nRationale: This explores a slight variation on the \"AAABABA\" start, maintains the central \"AAAA\" cluster, and tests a new ending pattern.\n\nChain-of-thought reasoning:\na. The \"AABABA\" and \"AAABABA\" starting patterns have consistently shown to be crucial for good results, so we're continuing to use these.\nb. The central \"AAAA\" cluster appears to be important in our best results, so we're maintaining this in most proposals.\nc. Endings with \"BABA\", \"BABB\", and variations thereof have shown promise, so we're continuing to explore these.\nd. We're maintaining a balance between exploiting known good patterns (especially in proposals 1 and 2) and exploring new variations (in proposals 3, 4, and 5) to avoid getting stuck in a local minimum.\n\nThese proposals aim to refine our best results while still exploring the nearby solution space. We're focusing on returning to patterns that have been successful in the past, given the setback in the last batch, but still including some exploration to ensure we don't miss potential improvements. The strategy is to make small, targeted changes to our best sequences while also testing some variations to potentially uncover better solutions. We're particularly interested in seeing if we can improve upon the 1.150 distance achieved two batches ago."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nAABABABAAAAAABABBBAA: 1.663\nAABABABABAAAABABBABA: 6.003\nAAABABAABAAAAABABBBA: 4.208\nABBABABAAAAAABABBABA: 3.788\nAAABABABAAAAABAABABB: 1.268\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
