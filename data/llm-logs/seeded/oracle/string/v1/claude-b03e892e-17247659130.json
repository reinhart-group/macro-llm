Exploit the successful pattern of \"AAAABABABAAAAABAABAB\" by making small adjustments.\n2. Focus on the position and length of the \"AAAA\" cluster in the middle, which seems to be a key factor in lowering the distance.\n3. Explore slight variations in the distribution of 'B's, particularly in the latter part of the sequence.\n4. Test different lengths of the initial and middle 'A' streaks.\n\nWe're very close to the target of 1.34, so these proposals aim to make careful, targeted adjustments that might push us below that threshold. We're focusing heavily on exploitation of our best result while still maintaining a small degree of exploration to avoid getting stuck in a local minimum."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nAAAABABABAAAAABABABB: 4.691\nAAAABABABABAAABAABAB: 6.007\nAAAABABABAAAAABABBAB: 4.461\nAAAAABABABAAAABAABAB: 7.159\nAAAABABABAAAAAABABAB: 6.003\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.

Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
