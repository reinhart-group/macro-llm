It explores whether a longer streak of 'A's in the middle can yield better results while keeping the effective start and end.\n\nThese proposals continue to exploit the patterns we've observed in the successful sequences while still exploring new variations. They focus on small modifications to our best recent solution, particularly in the distribution of 'A's and 'B's throughout the sequence.\n\nWe're maintaining the 'BABA' start that has been consistently effective, while exploring different distributions of 'A's and 'B's in the middle and slight variations at the end. This approach aims to find a balance between exploiting known good patterns and exploring potentially better solutions, with the goal of finding sequences that fall below the 1.34 threshold.\n\nWe're also trying to incorporate insights from earlier successful solutions, such as the importance of the sequence's start and end, while focusing on refining the middle section where there seems to be more room for improvement."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nBABAAABBAAAAABABAAAA: 4.477\nBABAAABBAAAABABABABA: 7.409\nBABABABBAAAAABABABAA: 1.567\nBABAABBAAAAABABABAAA: 0.545\nBABAABBBAAAAABABABAA: 1.451\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
