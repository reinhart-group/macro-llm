Making subtle modifications to the highly successful pattern we've discovered\n\nWe're aiming to find sequences that can match or improve upon the 0.617 distance while continuing to explore the solution space. The focus is on making careful adjustments to the best pattern we've found, while also testing variations that might uncover even better solutions. We're particularly interested in the role of the sequence's start and end, as well as the positioning of the 'BBBB' cluster that appears in our best solutions."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nABAABBABAABBBBAAABAB: 0.472\nABAABBABAABBBBAAAABA: 3.486\nABAABBABAABBBBAABABA: 1.340\nABAABBABAABBBAAAABBA: 2.642\nBAABAABBABAAABBAAAAB: 5.760\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions. Please propose five new 20-character sequences (12 'A', 8 'B') that build upon the insights from these results to yield distances closer to the target. Remember to: 1. Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
