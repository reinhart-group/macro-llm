We're exploring different placements of the 'BBB' triplet that appeared in our best performer, as well as breaking it up to see if that yields better results. We're also testing the importance of the ending sequence, as small changes there seem to significantly impact the results.\n\nBy maintaining the successful \"BAABAABAABAA\" prefix in most proposals, we're leveraging what seems to be a consistently good starting pattern while exploring various endings. This approach balances exploitation of known good patterns with exploration of new possibilities in the latter part of the sequence."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nBAABAABAABAABBBBAAAA: 15.846\nBAABAABAABAABBBBAABA: 1.452\nBAABAABAABAABBBABABA: 0.647\nBAABAABAABBAAABBAAAB: 0.842\nBAABAABAABAABABBBABA: 0.587\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions. Please propose five new 20-character sequences (12 'A', 8 'B') that build upon the insights from these results to yield distances closer to the target. Remember to: 1. Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
