They consider the influence of character sequence, particularly the importance of the 'BAAB' and 'BAABBA' motifs, the position of 'B' characters, and the impact of slight variations in the pattern, especially at the end of the sequence.\n\nThe strategy involves making small changes to the best-known sequences while also testing more significant variations to continue exploring the solution space and avoid getting stuck in a local minimum. We're focusing on sequences that start with 'BAAB' or 'BAABBA' as these seem to be common features in good solutions, while also exploring different distributions of 'B' characters throughout the sequence.\n\nThe goal is to find sequences that might improve upon the 0.904 result or discover other sequences in the same performance range. We're also maintaining some diversity in our proposals to ensure we don't overlook potentially good solutions, and revisiting some patterns that were successful in earlier iterations to see if they can be improved upon."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nBAABBAABABAABAABBABB: 2.866\nBAABBAABABAABAABBAAA: 11.922\nBAABBAABABAABAABAABB: 2.032\nBAABAABABAABAAAAABBA: 7.833\nBAABBABAABAABAABABAA: 5.863\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
