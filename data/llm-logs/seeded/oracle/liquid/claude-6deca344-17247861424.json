Combining elements from different successful sequences\n\nThis approach balances exploitation of our best solutions with careful exploration of nearby sequence space. We're aiming to:\n- Refine our understanding of what makes these successful sequences effective\n- Potentially uncover even better solutions by making small, strategic changes\n- Explore the sensitivity of the distance metric to small changes in the sequence\n\nBy including variations of recent good solutions, the optimal solution, and a hybrid of successful patterns, we're ensuring a diverse yet focused search strategy that builds upon our accumulated knowledge from previous iterations. We're particularly interested in understanding the impact of small changes at the end of sequences and the effect of combining successful patterns from different solutions."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nBAABAABBABAABABBAAAA: 17.190\nBAABABBAABAABAABBABB: 3.633\nBAABAABAABABBABBAAAA: 15.787\nBAABAABBABAABABBAABA: 1.116\nBAABAABAABAABABBBAAB: 0.513\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.

Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
