They all maintain the required 12 'A's and 8 'B's and avoid duplicating previously evaluated sequences.\n\nThe focus is on making small variations to the optimal solution, particularly in the distribution of 'B's and the ending pattern. We're also exploring combinations of elements from different successful sequences to see if we can find other nearby good solutions. Given that we've found an optimal solution, these proposals aim to explore the nearby solution space to potentially find other good solutions or to understand the sensitivity of the distance metric to small changes in the sequence."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nBAABAABAABAABAABAAAB: 0.906\nBAABAABBABAABAABAAAB: 0.393\nBAABAABBABAABABBAAAB: 0.219\nBAAAAABAABAABABBAAAA: 14.862\nBAABAABAABABBAABBABA: 1.754\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.

Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
