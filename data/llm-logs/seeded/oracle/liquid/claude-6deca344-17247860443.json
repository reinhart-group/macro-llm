We're focusing on fine-tuning these patterns and exploring slight variations.\n\nThe proposals maintain a balance between exploiting known good solutions (by including our three best performers so far) and exploring nearby variations (by adjusting the positions of 'B' characters, especially in the latter half of the sequence). This approach allows us to potentially find even better results while ensuring we don't drift too far from the successful patterns we've identified.\n\nWe're continuing to avoid sequences with long stretches of 'A' characters, as previous results consistently show this is not a promising direction. Instead, we're focusing on maintaining a relatively even distribution of 'B' characters throughout the sequence while preserving the successful start and middle patterns we've observed.\n\nBy including variations of our best performers and reintroducing a previous top performer, we're thoroughly exploring the neighborhood of these excellent solutions in search of potential improvements. This strategy helps us ensure we're converging on the global optimum rather than getting stuck in a local minimum."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nBAABABABAABAABBABABA: 0.770\nBAABABAABAABAABBAABB: 2.367\nBAABABABAABABBBAABAB: 1.054\nBAABABAABAAABABABAAB: 1.425\nBAABABAABAABBABABBAB: 1.877\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
