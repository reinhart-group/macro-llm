BBAABBABAABAABAABABA\nRationale: This sequence starts with \"BBAA\" and then incorporates elements from successful patterns we've seen before. It explores whether a different distribution of the 'B' characters at the beginning can still produce a good result while maintaining some successful elements.\n\nThese proposals continue to balance exploitation of the successful patterns (particularly the \"BBAABBABBABAA\" prefix from the best result) with exploration of new variations. They maintain the required 12 'A' and 8 'B' characters while investigating different arrangements, particularly in the beginning and end of the sequence.\n\nThe focus remains on subtle variations of the most successful sequences we've seen (BBAABBABBABAABAABABA and BAABBABBABAABAABAABA), while also exploring alternative patterns that maintain elements of successful sequences from earlier iterations. This approach aims to refine our understanding of what contributes to a low distance while also exploring diverse possibilities to avoid getting stuck in local minima. We're particularly focusing on the arrangement of 'A' and 'B' characters in the first few and last few positions, as these seem to be critical in determining the distance."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nBBAABBABBABAABAABABB: 2.628\nBBAABBABBABAABAABAAB: 1.251\nBBAABBABBABAABABABAA: 5.981\nBAABBABBABAABAABABAA: 3.828\nBBAABBABAABAABAABABA: 3.358\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions. Please propose five new 20-character sequences (12 'A', 8 'B') that build upon the insights from these results to yield distances closer to the target. Remember to: 1. Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
