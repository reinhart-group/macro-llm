Experimenting with different ending patterns.\n\nAll sequences maintain the required 12 'A' and 8 'B' characters and avoid duplicating previously evaluated sequences. The goal is to find more sequences with distances below 1.34 while potentially improving upon the best result of 0.803 from the last batch."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nBAABAABAABABBABAAABB: 0.999\nABAABAABAABABBABAAAB: 0.725\nBAABAABAABABBABABABA: 1.966\nBABAABAABAABABBAAABA: 8.234\nBAABAABAABAABABBABBA: 0.541\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions. Please propose five new 20-character sequences (12 'A', 8 'B') that build upon the insights from these results to yield distances closer to the target. Remember to: 1. Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
