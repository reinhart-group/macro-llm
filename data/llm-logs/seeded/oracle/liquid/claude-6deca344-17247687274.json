Fine-tuning the arrangement of 'B's in the latter half of the sequence, particularly the last 5-6 characters.\n4. Balancing the distribution of 'B's between the start and end of the sequence.\n\nThis approach balances refining our promising solutions (especially those with distances under 1.34) with continued exploration of slightly different arrangements of 'B's in the latter part of the sequence. We're particularly interested in the exact positioning of the 'B's in the last 5-6 characters, as this seems to be crucial for achieving the best results.\n\nBy reintroducing some of our top performers from previous batches, we're also ensuring that we maintain a consistent benchmark and don't overlook any potentially optimal patterns as we continue to explore the solution space."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nBAABAABAABAABBABABAB: 1.275\nBABBAABAABAABABAABAB: 0.994\nBAABAABAABAABAABAABA: 1.551\nBAAAAABAABAABABAABAB: 5.627\nBAABAABAABAABAABBBBA: 0.279\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions. Please propose five new 20-character sequences (12 'A', 8 'B') that build upon the insights from these results to yield distances closer to the target. Remember to: 1. Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
