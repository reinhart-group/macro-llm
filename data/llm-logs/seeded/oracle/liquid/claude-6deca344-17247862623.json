It provides a slightly different 'B' distribution pattern that's worth investigating further.\n\nThese proposals focus on revisiting our previously successful patterns, particularly those with distances under 1.34. We're maintaining the 'BAABAA' prefix that appears in all our best solutions while exploring slight variations in the latter part of the sequence.\n\nThe strategy here is to refine our understanding of what makes a good solution by closely examining the subtle differences between our top performers. We're being more conservative in our exploration, given the recent setback, by sticking closer to known good solutions. \n\nThis approach aims to yield more consistent results while still leaving room for potential improvements. By revisiting our best performers from various iterations, we're ensuring that we don't lose track of good solutions and can compare their performance across different batches.\n\nWe're particularly focusing on the arrangement of 'B's in the latter half of the sequence, as this seems to be the critical factor in determining the distance. The slight variations in each proposal allow us to systematically test the impact of small changes in 'B' distribution on the resulting distance."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nBAABAABBABAABABABABA: 1.643\nBAABAABABBAAAABBAABA: 3.977\nBAABAABAABABBABBAAAB: 1.273\nBAAAAABBABAABABBAABA: 5.973\nBAABBABBABAABABBBABA: 1.098\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
