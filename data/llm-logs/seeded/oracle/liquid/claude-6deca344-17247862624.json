BAABABBAABAAABABBAAB\nRationale: This sequence maintains the successful 'BAABABBAABAA' start from the best result but introduces a different pattern in the latter half. It explores whether a different distribution of 'B's in the second half can yield good results.\n\nThese proposals continue to exploit the patterns observed in the best-performing sequences while introducing new variations to explore the solution space. They all maintain the 'BAABAB' or 'BAABA' pattern at the beginning, which has been present in the good solutions from the last batch.\n\nThis approach balances refining promising solutions with exploring nearby variations in the solution space. We're aiming to find more good solutions (with distances less than 1.34) or potentially even better solutions than those already found. We're particularly focusing on:\n\n1. The impact of the final few characters in the sequence, especially for the best-performing patterns.\n2. The distribution of 'B' characters in the latter half of the sequence.\n3. Maintaining the overall structure that has proven successful while introducing small variations.\n4. Confirming the consistency of good results from the previous batch.\n\nBy doing this, we hope to further refine our understanding of what makes a sequence perform well and potentially discover new patterns that lead to even better solutions. We're also checking the consistency of previously successful sequences to ensure we're not overlooking any promising areas of the solution space."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nBAABABBAABAABAABBABA: 0.562\nBAABABBAABAABAABABAB: 2.099\nBAABABBAABAABABAABBA: 1.132\nBAABABBAABAAABABBAAB: 3.222\nBAAAAABAABAABABBBABA: 3.707\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
