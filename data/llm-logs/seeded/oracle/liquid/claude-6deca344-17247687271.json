BAABAABAABAABABBAAAA\nReasoning: This sequence is very similar to the known good result, with only the last 'B' changed to an 'A'. This allows us to explore if slight variations of the good solution can yield even better results or if the exact positioning of 'B's is crucial.\n\n2.

They all maintain the required 12 'A's and 8 'B's and avoid duplicating any previously evaluated sequences (except for the two we're deliberately retesting for comparison). \n\nWe're focusing on sequences that start with 'BAABAB', as this pattern has been present in many of our best solutions. We're also exploring different arrangements of 'B's towards the end of the sequence, as this seems to be a critical factor in determining the distance.\n\nBy making small modifications to known good solutions and combining elements from different successful sequences, we're balancing exploitation of promising areas with exploration of new possibilities."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nBAABABAABAABAABBABBA: 0.705\nBAABABBAABAABAABBAAA: 12.730\nBAABABBAAAAABAABBBBA: 17.571\nBAABAABAABAABAABBABB: 2.214\nBAABABBAABAABAAABABA: 0.839\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
