Trying variations in the distribution of 'B's within the sequence.\n5. Exploring the effect of starting the sequence with 'A' instead of 'B'.\n\nThis approach aims to balance between refining our current best solution and exploring new possibilities that might lead to further improvements. We're being careful to avoid proposing duplicate sequences while still leveraging the insights gained from previous iterations. The goal is to find sequences that maintain the successful elements we've discovered while potentially uncovering even better configurations."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nBABABABABABAAABAAAAA: 2.512\nBABABABABAABAAAAAAAA: 0.677\nABABABABABABAAAAAAAA: 2.721\nBABABABABAAAAAAAAAAA: 0.978\nBBBABABABABAAAAAAAAA: 0.917\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions. Please propose five new 20-character sequences (12 'A', 8 'B') that build upon the insights from these results to yield distances closer to the target. Remember to: 1. Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
