We're also playing with the length and position of continuous 'A' sequences. At the same time, we're introducing some variations to ensure we're not overlooking other potential optimal arrangements and to continue refining our search in the most promising areas of the solution space."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nBBBBBBAABAAAAAABAAAB: 6.644\nBBBBBABABABAAAABAAAA: 1.725\nBBBBBBAABAAAAAAAAAAA: 0.380\nBBBABABABAAAAAABAAAA: 1.331\nBBBBBBAABBAAAAABAAAA: 1.412\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.

Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
