We're making small, targeted changes to the most promising sequence, aiming to find the optimal arrangement that will push the distance below 1.34. Given how close we are to the target, these minor adjustments could be crucial in finding the optimal solution."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nAAAAAAAABABABBAAAAAA: 1.725\nAAAAAAAABABBABAAAAAA: 2.042\nAAAAAAABAAABBAAAAAAA: 1.594\nAABAAAAABABABBAAAAAA: 3.767\nAAAAAAAABBBBABAAAAAA: 2.647\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions. Please propose five new 20-character sequences (12 'A', 8 'B') that build upon the insights from these results to yield distances closer to the target. Remember to: 1. Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
