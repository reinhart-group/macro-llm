Maintaining a large initial block of 'A's (12 in most cases)\n2. Introducing a cluster of 'B's (usually 3-4)\n3. Exploring different patterns for the last few characters, including some alternation\n\nBy balancing these factors and building on our most successful sequences so far, we aim to discover arrangements that yield even lower distances. We're particularly focusing on refining the patterns that have consistently performed well (like AAAAAAAAAAAABBBAABBB) while still introducing some novel arrangements to avoid getting stuck in local minima."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nAAAAAAAAAAAABBBAABBA: 1.291\nAAAAAAAAAAABBBABBBAB: 1.264\nABAAAAAAAAAABBBABBAB: 4.635\nAAAAABAAAAAABBBAABBB: 4.000\nAAAAAAAAAAAAABBAABBB: 2.406\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions. Please propose five new 20-character sequences (12 'A', 8 'B') that build upon the insights from these results to yield distances closer to the target. Remember to: 1. Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
