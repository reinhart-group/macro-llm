We're exploring if simplifying the end of the sequence can produce a good result.\n\nThese proposals aim to exploit the success of the 'BBBBBABBB' and 'BBABBABBB' patterns at the beginning, which have performed well. We're exploring variations in the arrangement of 'A's and 'B's after these initial patterns, particularly focusing on the distribution of 'A's in the latter part of the sequence.\n\nThis approach balances the exploitation of known good solutions (particularly the two sequences with distances less than 1.34) with the exploration of nearby possibilities that might lead to even better results. We're focusing on small changes to the best-performing sequences, as it seems we're close to optimal solutions and fine-tuning might yield further improvements."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nBBBBBABBBAAABAABAAAA: 3.392\nBBABBABBBAAABAAAAABA: 6.905\nBABBBABBBAAABAABAAAA: 4.002\nBBABBABBBAABBAAAAABA: 5.969\nBABABABBBAAABAABAAAA: 5.286\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions. Please propose five new 20-character sequences (12 'A', 8 'B') that build upon the insights from these results to yield distances closer to the target. Remember to: 1. Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
