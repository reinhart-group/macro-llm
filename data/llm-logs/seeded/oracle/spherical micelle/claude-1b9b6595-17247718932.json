Returning to previously successful structures as a baseline\n2. Exploring variations in the position and distribution of 'B's within the 'A' cluster\n3. Maintaining the overall structure that has proven successful in earlier iterations (cluster of 'B's at the start, followed by a predominant 'A' cluster with isolated 'B's)\n4. Trying small variations in the initial 'B' cluster structure\n\nThis approach aims to reset our search towards known good solutions while still allowing for exploration of the solution space, with the goal of finding sequences that yield distances closer to the target."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nBABABBBABAAABAAAAAAA: 1.575\nBABABABABAAABAAAAAAA: 1.896\nBABABAAABAAABAAAAAAA: 2.342\nBABABAAABAAABBAAAAAA: 4.179\nBABABAAAAAAABBAAAAAA: 4.524\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
