We're focusing on subtle changes in the arrangement of 'A's and 'B's, particularly in the middle of the sequence, as this seems to be the most critical area for optimization.\n\nBy proposing these variations, we aim to either find an even better solution or confirm that we're very close to the optimal sequence. The goal is to further minimize the distance metric, hopefully pushing us below the 0.859 we achieved with the best sequence from the last batch. We're balancing exploitation of our best-known pattern with exploration of nearby variations to ensure we don't miss any potential improvements."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nBBBBBBBBBAAABAAAAAAA: 0.908\nBBABBBBABAAABAAAAAAA: 1.265\nABBBBBBBBAAABAAAAAAA: 1.147\nABABBBBBBAAABAAAAAAA: 1.625\nBBABBBBABAAABAAABAAA: 5.841\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions. Please propose five new 20-character sequences (12 'A', 8 'B') that build upon the insights from these results to yield distances closer to the target. Remember to: 1. Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
