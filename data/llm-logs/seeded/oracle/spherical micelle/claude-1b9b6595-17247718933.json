It's a more exploratory option to see if this configuration might lead to another good solution.\n\nThese proposals aim to refine our understanding of the optimal structure, particularly focusing on the 'BABABBBB' and 'BABABBABB' patterns that have shown excellent results. They balance exploitation of the known good solutions (especially the two best-performing ones from this batch) with controlled exploration of nearby variations. We're maintaining the successful 'BABABB' or 'BABABBB' start and long 'A' sequence at the end, which have been consistent features in good solutions, while exploring subtle variations in the middle section of the sequence and the length of the final 'A' run."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nBABABBBBABAAAAAAAAAA: 2.090\nBABABBBABABAAAAAAAAA: 1.425\nBABABBBBAABAAAAAAAAA: 0.835\nBABABBBAABAABAAAAAAA: 0.992\nBBBABBABBAAAAAAAAAAA: 1.347\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions. Please propose five new 20-character sequences (12 'A', 8 'B') that build upon the insights from these results to yield distances closer to the target. Remember to: 1. Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
