BBBBBBABBABAAAAAAAA\nRationale: This sequence maintains the initial 'BBBBBBABB' pattern but introduces a single 'B' later in the sequence. We're testing if this small change in the distribution of 'B's can improve the result.\n\nThese proposals aim to exploit the success of our previously best solutions (BBBBBBABBAABAAAAAAAA and BBBBBBABBAAABAAAAAAA) by exploring nearby variations. We're focusing on subtle changes to the position and distribution of 'A's and 'B's within the sequence, as this continues to be a critical factor in achieving a low distance.\n\nWe're particularly interested in maintaining the pattern of a long initial 'B' cluster followed by 'ABB' or 'ABA' sequences, as these seem to be key features in our best solutions. At the same time, we're still maintaining some level of exploration by testing variations in the length of the initial 'B' cluster, the distribution of 'A's and 'B's in the middle part, and the composition of the final sequence.\n\nThese proposals balance exploitation of our best-known solutions with continued exploration of the solution space, aiming to potentially discover even better patterns that yield good results. We're making small, strategic changes to see if we can further optimize the sequence and potentially find a solution with an even lower distance."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nBBBBBBAABBAAAAAAAAAA: 1.810\nBBBBBBABBAAAAAAAAAAB: 5.896\nBBBABBABBAABAAAAAAAA: 0.186\nBBBBBBABBAAABAAABBAA: 9.021\nBBBBBBBAAAAABAAAAAAA: 3.938\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions. Please propose five new 20-character sequences (12 'A', 8 'B') that build upon the insights from these results to yield distances closer to the target. Remember to: 1. Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
