The end part, where we're testing different lengths of the final 'A' sequence and even introducing a final 'B'.\n\nThis approach balances exploitation of our best results with some exploration of nearby sequence space. We're making small, targeted changes to the best-performing sequence to see if we can further optimize the distance metric, while also testing some slightly more divergent sequences to potentially uncover new insights about the optimal structure.\n\nThe goal is to find sequences that maintain or improve upon the excellent performance we've already achieved, while also exploring slightly different arrangements that might reveal new insights about the optimal structure. We're particularly focusing on the successful \"BBAAAAA\" start and the transition to 'A's in the middle of the sequence, as these seem to be critical factors in achieving low distances."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nBBAAAABBAAABAAAAAAAA: 1.710\nBBAAAAABBABBAAAAAAAA: 1.876\nBBAAAAABBAABBAAAAAAA: 2.102\nBBABAAABBAABAAAAAAAA: 1.068\nBBAAAABBAAABAAAABAAA: 7.679\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions. Please propose five new 20-character sequences (12 'A', 8 'B') that build upon the insights from these results to yield distances closer to the target. Remember to: 1. Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
