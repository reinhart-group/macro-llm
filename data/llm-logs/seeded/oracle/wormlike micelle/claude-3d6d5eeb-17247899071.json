It tests whether introducing more alternation in the middle affects the result positively.\n\n4. ABBAABBAAABBBBBAAAAA\nRationale: This increases the length of the 'B' sequence in the latter part of the string, based on the observation that longer 'B' sequences seemed to perform better in this batch.\n\n5. AABBAABBAAABABBAAAAA\nRationale: This starts with 'AA' instead of 'A', testing if front-loading more 'A's while maintaining a similar overall structure to our previous best can yield a good result.\n\nChain-of-thought reasoning:\na. The sequence ABBAABBAAABABBBAAAAA (our previous best with 0.444) seems to still be promising, as variations didn't improve upon it.\nb. Starting with 'ABBA' continues to be effective and is maintained in most proposals.\nc. The middle section 'AABA' or 'ABABA' seems to be important, but we're still exploring the best configuration.\nd. Longer sequences of 'B' in the latter part of the string seemed to perform better in this batch, so we're exploring this further.\n\nThis batch aims to balance between returning to our previous best solution and exploring new variations that might yield improvements. We're particularly interested in the effects of small changes to the middle and end of the sequence, as well as the distribution of 'A's and 'B's throughout. The goal remains to find configurations that yield distances under 1.34 or to push the distance even closer to 0."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nABBAABBAAABABBBBABAA: 14.284\nABBAABBAABABABBAAAAA: 3.129\nABBAABBAAABBBBBAAAAA: 1.484\nAABBAABBAAABABBAAAAA: 0.853\nABBAAABAAABABBBAAAAA: 2.959\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.

Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
