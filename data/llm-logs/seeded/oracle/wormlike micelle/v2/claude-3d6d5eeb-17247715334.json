The variations are subtle, allowing us to fine-tune our understanding of what leads to the lowest distances. We're avoiding previously evaluated sequences and balancing exploitation of the known good solutions with exploration of nearby sequence space.\n\nBy making these small changes, we hope to either find an even better solution or confirm that we're very close to the optimal sequence. The focus remains on the arrangement of 'A's and 'B's, particularly in the beginning, middle, and end sections, as these seem to be critical in determining the distance metric. We're exploring various patterns of 'A's and 'B's while maintaining the overall structure that has proven successful so far."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nBBABABABBAABABBAAAAA: 1.980\nBBABAAABAAABABBAAABA: 12.101\nBBABABABBABBABBAAAAA: 3.578\nBBABAAABAAABBBBAAABA: 11.661\nABABABABBABBABBAAAAA: 4.617\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
