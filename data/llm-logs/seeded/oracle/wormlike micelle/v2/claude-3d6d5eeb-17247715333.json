We're revisiting some previously successful patterns while also introducing slight variations to explore the nearby solution space. Our goal remains to find a solution below the 1.34 threshold, and these proposals aim to fine-tune the most promising patterns we've seen so far, with particular attention to the sequences that have produced distances close to 2.0 in the last batch."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nBBAAABABAABAABBAABAA: 12.850\nBBAAABBAAABAABBAAAAA: 1.862\nBBAABBBAAABAABBAAAAA: 0.965\nBBAAABABAABABBBAABAA: 12.259\nBBAAAABBAABAABBAAABA: 12.799\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions. Please propose five new 20-character sequences (12 'A', 8 'B') that build upon the insights from these results to yield distances closer to the target. Remember to: 1. Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
