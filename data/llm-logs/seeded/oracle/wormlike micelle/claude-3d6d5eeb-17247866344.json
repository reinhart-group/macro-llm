We're focusing heavily on variations of our best-performing sequence from the last batch, exploring small changes that might lead to even better results.\n\nWe're particularly interested in the role of the 'BBBB' group at the end, the distribution of 'A's in the middle, and the impact of the trailing 'A's. This approach balances exploitation of our recent good result with some exploration of the nearby solution space. \n\nThe goal remains to find sequences that yield distances below 1.34, with a particular focus on trying to improve upon our current best result of 1.709. We're also keeping in mind our previously found good solutions (0.493 and 0.345) as we continue to explore the solution space."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nBBAABBBABAAABBBBAAAB: 13.961\nBBAABBBAABAABBBBAAAA: 2.506\nBBAAABBABAAABBBBAAAA: 2.477\nBBAABBBAAAAABBBBAABA: 5.902\nBBAABBBABAAABABBAAAB: 13.851\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
