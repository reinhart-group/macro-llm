BBABAABAAAABBBAAAAA\nRationale: This sequence maintains the successful 'BBABA' start but reduces the number of consecutive 'B's. It tests whether spreading out the 'B' characters more evenly can improve the result.\n\n5. BBAAABBBAAAABBBAAAAA\nRationale: This is our original best result (0.000). Given that we've found new good solutions, it's worth proposing this again to compare directly and see if it remains the best overall.\n\nThese proposals balance exploitation of our new good results (0.230 and 0.897) and the original best result (0.000) with continued exploration of new patterns. They all maintain the required 12 'A' and 8 'B' characters while testing various arrangements that might yield even better results.\n\nThe rationales consider the influence of character sequence, the role of 'A' and 'B' characters, and insights from our good results. We're focusing on fine-tuning the successful patterns we've discovered, particularly the 'BBABA' start that led to our latest best result, while still allowing for some exploration in the middle and end sections. The goal is to see if we can further improve upon our best result or find more good solutions in the nearby sequence space."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nBBABAABBAAABBBBAABAA: 8.691\nBBABAABBAABBBBBAAAAA: 1.312\nBBAAABABAAAABBBAABAA: 8.856\nBBAAABBBBAAABBBBAAAA: 2.045\nBBABAABBAAABBBBABBAA: 9.933\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
