The impact of the \"AAAA\" vs \"AABA\" vs \"ABAB\" patterns in the middle.\n3. Small adjustments to the end of the sequence.\n\nThe proposals avoid duplicating previous sequences (except for reintroducing our best known solution) and aim to refine our understanding of what leads to the lowest distances. We're trying to balance exploitation of our good solutions with some exploration to potentially find even better sequences. By making these targeted variations, we hope to uncover more sequences that fall below the 1.34 threshold."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nBBAAABBABAAABBBAAAAA: 0.720\nBBBAAABAAABAABBAAAAA: 3.006\nBBAAABBABAAABBAAAAAA: 3.605\nABBAAABAAABAABBAAAAA: 4.782\nBBAAABBABAAABBAABAAA: 5.764\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions. Please propose five new 20-character sequences (12 'A', 8 'B') that build upon the insights from these results to yield distances closer to the target. Remember to: 1. Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
