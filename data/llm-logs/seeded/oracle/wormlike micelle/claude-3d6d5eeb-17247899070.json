It tests whether increasing the concentration of 'B's at the very beginning while maintaining the overall pattern can improve the distance.\n\nThese proposals aim to balance exploitation of our best-known solution and the close solution from the last batch with careful exploration of nearby solution space. They maintain the required 12 'A' and 8 'B' characters while testing various subtle modifications to good sequences we've seen before. This strategy allows us to fine-tune our understanding of what makes a sequence perform well, particularly focusing on small adjustments to the arrangement of 'A's and 'B's in the first half of the sequence."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nAAABABBBAAAABBBAAAAA: 1.094\nAAABABBAAABABBBAAAAA: 2.812\nAAABBBBAAAAABBBAAAAA: 0.986\nAAABABBBAAAABBBBAAAA: 4.607\nAAABABBAAABABBBBAAAA: 3.383\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.

Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
