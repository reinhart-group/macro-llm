We're giving it another try to see if it performs better in the context of our recent explorations.\n\n5. BBBAABBBAABBBAAAABAA:\nReasoning: This sequence keeps the 'BBB' start that has been consistently good, maintains three 'B's in the middle instead of four, and explores a different distribution of 'A's at the end.\n\nThese sequences maintain the required 12 'A's and 8 'B's while focusing on exploiting our recent promising results and previous good solutions. They avoid duplicating previously evaluated sequences and aim to provide variations that could potentially improve upon our best results. \n\nThe proposals incorporate insights from successful sequences, particularly:\n1. The importance of the 'BBB' start\n2. The potential benefit of a 'BBBB' group in the middle\n3. Various arrangements of 'A's, especially towards the end of the sequence\n\nWe're continuing to explore variations to try to achieve a distance below 1.34, balancing between exploiting known good patterns and exploring new arrangements."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nBBBAAABBBAABBBBAABAA: 11.231\nBBBAABBBAABBBAAAABAA: 8.035\nBBBAABBBAABABBAAAAAA: 3.246\nBBBAABBBAABBBAAAAABA: 9.506\nBBBAABBAAABBBBAAAAAA: 2.642\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
