Maintain a general structure of alternating groups of 'A's and 'B's\n\nBy proposing variations of our best performers and combining elements from different successful sequences, we're attempting to fine-tune our results. We're particularly interested in exploring the space around our previous best result (0.124) and the near-threshold result (1.343).\n\nThis approach balances exploitation of our current best solutions with continued exploration of the problem space. We're aiming to either improve upon our excellent 0.124 result, push the 1.343 result below the threshold, or find other good solutions in the process."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nBBBAAABBAABBBBBABAAA: 5.819\nBBBAAABBABABBBBAAAAA: 2.808\nBBBAABBBAAABBBBAAAAA: 0.700\nBBBAAABBAAABABBAAAAA: 0.199\nBBBABBBAAAAABABAAAAA: 1.614\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
