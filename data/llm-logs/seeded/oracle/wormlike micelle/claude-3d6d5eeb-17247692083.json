The arrangement of 'A's and 'B's at the end of the sequence\n\nWe're also exploring whether slight modifications to successful patterns can lead to even better results, particularly by adjusting the end of the sequence or the grouping of 'B's in the start and middle of the sequence. The goal is to further refine our understanding of what makes a sequence optimal for this particular metric and potentially find new solutions that fall below the 1.34 threshold."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nBBBAAABBAAABBABAAAAB: 9.642\nBBBAAABBAAABBABAAABA: 11.208\nBBBAAABAAAABBABAAABA: 11.480\nBBBAAABBAAABBABAABAA: 9.886\nBBBAAABBAAABAABAAAAB: 13.622\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.

Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
