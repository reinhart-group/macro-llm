They all maintain the required 12 'A' and 8 'B' character count and avoid duplicating previously evaluated sequences (except for the deliberate inclusion of our two best-known solutions).\n\nThe focus is on maintaining the successful start patterns we've seen before while exploring different distributions of 'B's in the middle and latter parts of the sequence. We're avoiding placing 'B's at the very end of the sequence, as that seemed to negatively impact the results in the previous batch.\n\nBy proposing these sequences, we hope to either rediscover what makes our best solutions effective or find new patterns that yield good results. This approach allows us to refine our understanding of the problem space while still leaving room for potential improvements."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nBABAAABBABABBBAAAAAA: 4.697\nBABAAABBAAAABBBABAAA: 6.895\nBBBAAABBABAABBBAAAAA: 1.984\nAABAAABBAABBBBAAAAAA: 6.903\nBABBAAABBABAABBAAAAA: 2.353\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.
