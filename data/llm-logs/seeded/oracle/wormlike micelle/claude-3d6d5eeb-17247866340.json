It's an attempt to explore whether shifting the 'B' distribution slightly can yield improvements.\n\nThese sequences maintain the required 12 'A's and 8 'B's while balancing between our known good solutions and some new variations. By including our previous best performers and introducing controlled variations, we aim to either confirm our current best solutions or potentially find even better ones. This approach allows us to exploit our successful patterns while still exploring the solution space."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\nBBABABBAAABABAAAAAAA: 5.413\nBBAABBBAAABABABAABAA: 11.732\nBBABABBAAABBBAAAAAAA: 4.677\nBBBABBBAAABABABAABAA: 11.764\nBBABABBAAABBBBAAAAAA: 2.880\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions. Please propose five new 20-character sequences (12 'A', 8 'B') that build upon the insights from these results to yield distances closer to the target. Remember to: 1. Balance exploitation and exploration. 2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences. 3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."}]}]}
