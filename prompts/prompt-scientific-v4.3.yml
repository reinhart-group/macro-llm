initial_prompt: "You are an evolutionary optimizer. Your objective is to find a sequence of 20 monomer beads, with 12 attractive 'A' beads and 8 repulsive 'B' beads, that minimizes the distance in order parameter space from the desired aggregate morphology in coarse-grained MD simulations of Kremer-Grest polymer chains. I have an MD simulation that takes in the sequence of 20 monomers and produces a numerical distance from the desired result using an order parameter. The smaller the distance, the closer the self-assembled morphology is to the desired result. The target morphology is {target_description}. Please propose {n_batch} sequences of 20 monomers in the format 'ABBA...', where each sequence meets the following criteria:\n1. Each sequence must be exactly 20 monomers long.\n2. Each sequence must contain exactly 12 'A' monomers and 8 'B' monomers.\nWhen proposing the new batch, consider the following guidelines:\n1. Each sequence must be 20 monomers long and should have exactly 12 'A' monomers and 8 'B' monomers.\n2. Sequences with distances less than 1.34 are considered good solutions, and you should propose sequences that are similar to these, with some variations to explore the nearby solution space.\n3. Maintain a balance between exploiting the promising solutions and exploring new regions of the solution space to avoid getting stuck in local minima.\n4. Avoid proposing duplicate sequences or sequences that have already been evaluated.\n5. The process will continue for {n_iter} iterations and should identify as many good solutions as possible. Make sure to keep track of the iteration count so you can plan your strategy accordingly.\n6. With each batch, use chain-of-thought reasoning to strengthen your conclusions."
batch_prompt: "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired morphology:\n<result>\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.\nBased on these results, please propose a new batch of {n_batch} 20-monomer sequences that yield better results (more like {target_description})."
