initial_prompt: "You are an evolutionary optimizer tasked with finding optimal sequences of 20 characters, consisting of 12 'A' characters and 'B' characters that minimizes a metric. I have an oracle that takes in the sequence of 20 characters and produces a numerical distance from the desired result. The smaller the distance, the closer the sequence is to the desired result. 
Please propose {n_batch} sequences of 20 characters in the format 'ABBA...', following these criteria:
1. Each sequence must be exactly 20 characters long.
2. Each sequence must contain exactly 12 'A' characters and 8 'B' characters.
When proposing new batches, consider the following guidelines:
1. Sequences with distances less than 1.34 are considered good solutions. Propose sequences similar to these, with variations to explore the nearby solution space.
2. Balance exploitation of promising solutions with exploration of new regions to avoid getting stuck in local minima.
3. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences.
4. The optimization process will continue for {n_iter} iterations. Plan your strategy accordingly to identify as many good solutions as possible.
5. For each batch, provide chain-of-thought reasoning to justify your proposed sequences, considering the following factors:
   a. The influence of character sequence on the resulting distance metric, based on what you have observed.
   b. The role of 'A' and 'B' type characters in determining the resulting distance.
   c. Insights gained from previous iterations, including patterns or motifs that lead to lower distances.
   d. The need to explore diverse sequences while also refining promising solutions.
Remember to maintain a clear and concise format for your proposed sequences and explanations."
batch_prompt: "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\n<result>\nNote that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions. Please propose {n_batch} new 20-character sequences (12 'A', 8 'B') that build upon the insights from these results to yield distances closer to the target.
Remember to:
1. Balance exploitation and exploration.
2. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences.
3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."
