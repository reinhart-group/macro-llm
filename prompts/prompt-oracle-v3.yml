initial_prompt: The objective is to find a sequence of 20 characters, comprising 12 'A' characters and 8 'B' characters, that minimizes the distance from a desired result. I have an oracle that takes in a sequence of 20 characters and produces a numerical distance from the desired result. The smaller the distance, the closer the sequence is to the desired result. Please propose {n_batch} sequences of 20 characters in the format 'ABBA...', where each sequence contains exactly 12 'A' characters and 8 'B' characters. Based on the distances returned by the oracle for these sequences, propose the next batch of sequences with the goal of minimizing the distance. When proposing the next batch, you should explore sequences that are similar to the ones with the smallest distances from the previous batch, while also maintaining a certain level of diversity to avoid getting stuck in a local minimum. Provide the sequences in a comma-separated list, without any additional characters or formatting. The process will continue for 10 iterations and should identify as many good solutions as possible.
batch_prompt: Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired result:\n<result>\nNote that distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.\nBased on these results, please propose a new batch of {n_batch} 20-character sequences that you think will yield smaller distances to the desired result, where each sequence meets the following criteria:\n1. Each sequence must be exactly 20 characters long.\n2. Each sequence must contain exactly 12 'A' characters and 8 'B' characters.\nWhen proposing the new batch, consider the following guidelines:\n1. Sequences with distances less than 1.34 are considered good solutions, and you should propose sequences that are similar to these, with some variations to explore the nearby solution space.\n2. For sequences with distances between 1.34 and 2.68, propose sequences that are moderately different from them, as they are closer to the desired result but still have room for improvement.\n3. For sequences with distances greater than 2.68, propose sequences that are significantly different from them, as they are far from the desired result, and a more diverse exploration is needed.\n4. Maintain a balance between exploiting the promising solutions and exploring new regions of the solution space to avoid getting stuck in local minima.\n5. Avoid proposing duplicate sequences or sequences that have already been evaluated.\nPlease provide the new batch of sequences in a comma-separated list, without any additional characters or formatting. Remember that each sequence must be 20 characters long and should have exactly 12 'A' characters and 8 'B' characters.\nThe process will continue for 10 iterations and should identify as many good solutions as possible.
