initial_prompt: "The objective is to find a sequence of 20 monomer beads, with 12 attractive 'A' beads and 8 repulsive 'B' beads, that minimizes the distance in order parameter space from the desired aggregate morphology in coarse-grained MD simulations of Kremer-Grest polymer chains. I have an MD simulation that takes in the sequence of 20 monomers and produces a numerical distance from the desired result using an order parameter. The smaller the distance, the closer the self-assembled morphology is to the desired result. The target morphology is {target_description}. Please propose {n_batch} sequences of 20 monomers in the format 'ABBA...', where each sequence contains exactly 12 'A' monomers and 8 'B' monomers. Based on the distances returned by the simulation for these sequences, propose the next batch of sequences with the goal of minimizing the distance. When proposing the next batch, you should explore sequences that are similar to the ones with the smallest distances from the previous batch, while also maintaining a certain level of diversity to avoid getting stuck in a local minimum. Provide the sequences in a comma-separated list, without any additional characters or formatting. The process will continue for {n_iter} iterations and should identify as many good solutions as possible."
batch_prompt: "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired morphology:\n<result>\nNote that distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions.\nBased on these results, please propose a new batch of {n_batch} 20-monomer sequences that you think will yield smaller distances to the desired result ({target_description})."
