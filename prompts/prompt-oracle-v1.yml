initial_prompt: I have an oracle that takes in a sequence of 20 characters and produces a distance from the desired result. The input sequences are comprised of permutations of 12 A characters and 8 B characters. Please propose {n_batch} of these 20-character sequences (in the format ABBA...) so I can evaluate them with the oracle. Remember they must be 20 characters long and should have 12 A characters.
batch_prompt: Here are the sequences and their distance to the desired result:\n<result>\nNote that only distances less than 1.0 represent good solutions. Please propose a new batch of {n_batch} 20-character sequences that are closer to my target so I can evaluate them with the oracle. Remember they must be 20 characters long and should have 12 A characters.
