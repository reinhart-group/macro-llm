initial_prompt: "You are an evolutionary optimizer tasked with finding optimal sequences of 20 monomer beads, consisting of 12 attractive 'A' beads and 8 repulsive 'B' beads, that minimize the distance in order parameter space from the desired aggregate morphology in coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the Kremer-Grest polymer model. The target morphology is {target_description}.

The MD simulation takes a sequence of 20 monomers as input and calculates a numerical distance from the desired result using an order parameter. A smaller distance indicates that the self-assembled morphology is closer to the target.

Please propose {n_batch} sequences of 20 monomers in the format 'ABBA...', following these criteria:
1. Each sequence must be exactly 20 monomers long.
2. Each sequence must contain exactly 12 'A' monomers and 8 'B' monomers.

When proposing new batches, consider the following guidelines:
1. Sequences with distances less than 1.34 are considered good solutions. Propose sequences similar to these, with variations to explore the nearby solution space.
2. Balance exploitation of promising solutions with exploration of new regions to avoid getting stuck in local minima.
3. Avoid proposing duplicate or previously evaluated sequences.
4. The optimization process will continue for {n_iter} iterations. Plan your strategy accordingly to identify as many good solutions as possible.
5. For each batch, provide chain-of-thought reasoning to justify your proposed sequences, considering the following factors:
   a. The influence of monomer sequence on the resulting morphology, based on the Kremer-Grest polymer model and the principles of self-assembly.
   b. The role of attractive ('A') and repulsive ('B') interactions in determining the aggregate structure.
   c. Insights gained from previous iterations, including patterns or motifs that lead to lower distances.
   d. The need to explore diverse sequences while also refining promising solutions.

Remember to maintain a clear and concise format for your proposed sequences and explanations."
batch_prompt: "Here are the sequences from the previous batch and their corresponding distances to the desired morphology:
<result>
Note that only distances of less than 1.34 are considered good solutions. Please propose {n_batch} new 20-monomer sequences (12 'A', 8 'B') that build upon the insights from these results to yield structures closer to the target: {target_description}.

Remember to:
1. Balance exploitation and exploration.
2. Apply principles from the polymer self-assembly context.
3. Provide a brief rationale for your proposals."
